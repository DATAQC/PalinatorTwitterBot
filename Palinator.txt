
The future has not been written.

There is no fate but what  we make for ourselves.

I wish I could believe that.

My name is John Connor.

They tried to murder me  before I was born.

When I was    they tried again.

Machines from the future.

Terminators.

All my life, my mother told me  the storm was coming.

Judgment Day.  Connor!

The beginning of a war  between man and machines.

Three billion lives  would vanish in an instant.

And I would lead what was left  of the human race to ultimate victory.

It hasn't happened.

No bombs fell.

Computers didn't take control.

We stopped Judgment Day.

I should feel safe...

... but I don't.

So I live off the grid.

No phone, no address.

No one and nothing can find me.

I've erased all connections  to the past.

But as hard as I try...

... I can't erase my dreams...

... my nightmares.

I feel the weight of the future  bearing down on me.

A future I don't want.

So I keep running...

... as fast as I can.

Anywhere.

Nowhere.

Oh, my God.

Are you okay?

Do you want me to call    ?

I like this car.

What are you...?

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

Slow down and pull over immediately.

Lady, have you any idea how fast you were going?

Let me see your license and registration.

I like your gun.

What?

This stupid thing's not working.

What's wrong with this thing?

I hate machines.

Hello?   Kate, it's your father.

You're blowing me off again.

I'm so sorry. You know how much I wanted to see you this weekend.

We're having computer problems...  I know, you can't talk about it.

It's just...

...Scott was really looking forward to this.

Katie. I wish I had more time  to get to know him. I really do.

That's okay. You're bound to run into him at the wedding.

Please. I'm still in a state of denial about that.

You're not the only one.   Hey, kiddo.

You don't need me to pass judgment on this guy.

You've done the right thing your whole life.

You won't make a mistake.  You never do.

I'm the luckiest father  in the world, you know?

I've never had to be afraid for my daughter.

Listen, I hate this. I gotta run. Come  see me. I promise I won't cancel.

We will.

Bye, Dad, I love you.  Love you too.

Okay, what have we got?  This new computer virus is tricky.

It's infected half the civilian Internet as well as secondary military apps.

Payroll, inventory.  Primary defence nets are still clean?

So far the firewalls are holding up.

Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use our Al to scan the infrastructure.

Search and destroy for any hint of the virus.

I know, Tony, but that's like going after a fly with a bazooka.

Once the connection's made, it should only be a few minutes.

During which we put everything under the control of one computer system.

The most intelligent system ever conceived.

I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.

I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

Yes, sir.

Thanks.

You're supposed to go around to the back.

Hey, I said you're supposed to go...

Take off your clothes.  Patience, honey.

Bitch. Wait your turn.

Your clothes.  Talk to the hand.

Now.

Welcome to Jim's Burgers.  Can I take your order?

Jose Barrera?   Yeah, that's me.

Growing concern over widespread  outages in the global digital network...

... have prompted rumours  of a new computer supervirus.

Wall Street analysts are confident...  Shit! My mom's home.

Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer. Here. Take that.

Go, go, go.

Elizabeth and William Anderson?

I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs. Is there something wrong?

What's going on?

I have to go to the clinic. It's an emergency.

It's  :   in the morning.

Well, I'll be back before you get up.

Cool it, guys, it's just me.

We've got a sick cat coming in.

Great.

Junkies.

Please, don't do that.

I suppose it was you who ripped us off last week.

Put the phone down.

Sorry.

I just...

I needed some medicine.

There's an emergency clinic half a mile away.

Can't do that.

How much did you take?

Enough.  Well...

...this is the stuff we use to chemically neuter dogs.

Take a look.

Hey!

Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

Next time bring a clue, not a paintball gun.

No, this isn't what you think.  Yeah, right.

I think Hercules has got pneumonia. He started coughing and won't stop.

Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.  A problem? This is an emergency!

It sounds like a hairball.  I know what a hairball sounds like.

Where's Dr. Monroe?  It's  :   in the morning.

I'm sure he's home sleeping. He'll come in if he has to.

Just wait in here with Hercules and I'll be a few minutes, all right?

Mike Kripke's basement.

What? What does that mean?

You're John Connor.

I'm Kate Brewster.

We went to West Hills Junior High together.

Jesus.  What happened to you, John?

Middle of eighth grade, you just disappeared.

And there was that thing about your foster parents.

Yeah, they were murdered.

I didn't do it.

What the hell?

Is somebody with you?

Katherine Brewster?

No.

John Connor was here. Where did he go?

Tell me. Where did he go?

Katherine Brewster?

What are you doing? Let me down!

Let me down! Let me down!

Where is John Connor?

If I tell you, will you let me go?

Yes.

He's...

...in the kennel, in a cage.

You said that you'd let me go.

I lied.

Please, please, please. You have to let me go!

John Connor.

It is time.

You here to kill me?

No. You must live.

Why are you here?

Where are we going?  Keep moving.

Get out of here.

Now!

No pulse.  See if you can get him down.

I can't.

This guy weighs a ton.

   .  Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

Where are you now?  I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

It's a Toyota Tundra.

It says "Emery Animal Hospital" on the side. I'm locked inside the back.

Hello?

Hello?

Shit! Shit!

Get off.

Let me out!

What are you doing here?

You tell me. You got me into this.

Stop the car.  I can't. Not yet.

You bastard! Stop the car!  Shut up!

Son of a bitch.

Goddamn it.

Look what you did to my car.

This is my company car, asshole.

Get your ass out here.

Get your ass out of the car. Now!

What are you doing?

If you don't have insurance, I'm gonna rip your balls off.

I don't want any problems, okay?  Shut up!

Help!

Who's talking back there? What's going on?

Calm down.  Shut up!

I'm being kidnapped! Call the police!  Well, I'll be goddamned.

Call    !  A cop when you need one.

Help, please! Please!

Let me out of here! Help!

Get back here, asshole!

That's the cops! You have to pull over!

Yeah, first chance I get.

Hold on!

Stop it!

I'll drive.

Get out.

Excuse me.

Move over.

No sign of brain trauma.

Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

Do you even remember me?

Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne?

"Hasta la vista, baby." Ring any bells?

That was a different T   .

What, do you come off an assembly line or something?

Exactly.

Oh, man. I'm gonna have to teach you everything all over again.

Katherine Brewster, have you sustained injury?

Drop dead, you asshole!

I'm unable to comply.

Where are you taking me?

To a safe location.

All right, get off at the next exit. Let her out.

Negative. Katherine Brewster must be protected.

I thought they were after me.  You could not be located.

So a TX was sent back through time to eliminate your lieutenants.

So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

No, no. No, you shouldn't even exist.

I mean, we took out Cyberdyne over    years ago.

We stopped Judgment Day.  You only postponed it.

Judgment Day is inevitable.

I require a cutting tool.

Here, take the wheel.

What are you doing?  I am powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

My primary cell was damaged by a plasma attack.

TX is designed for extreme combat, driven by a plasma reactor...

...and equipped with onboard weapons.

Its arsenal includes...

...nanotechnological transjectors.

Meaning?  It can control other machines.

Its body chassis is heavily armoured and hardened to withstand attack.

You'll find a way to destroy her.  Unlikely.

I'm an obsolete design.

TX is faster, more powerful and more intelligent.

It's a far more effective killing machine.

Oh, great.

That's great.

My presence in this timeline has been anticipated.

TX is designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms.

So she's an antiTerminator Terminator?

You've gotta be shitting me.

No, I am not shitting you.

When ruptured, the fuel cells become unstable.

Relax.

Let me out of here!  Relax!

Man, this is wack.

It's been like this for hours. Every goddamn station.

Hey.

Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

Talk to the hand.

Help! Help me!

Help!

I think we better go.

Jerky?

You're kidnapping me.

Look...  God, you were always a delinquent.

And look at you now, sitting there like the badboy thing still works.

What are you, some kind of gang member?

How do you live with yourself?

What?

Tell her who I am.

John Connor is leader of the Worldwide Resistance...

...and last hope of humankind.

Right. And him?

He's a robot from the future.

Living tissue over a metal skeleton, sent back in time to protect me.

Go to hell.

He doesn't mean you any harm.

I have a fianc√©.

He's gonna be looking for me.

What is it that you want?

Just...

...imagine...

...if you knew you were gonna do something important with your life.

Something amazing.

Maybe the most important thing anyone has ever done.

But there's a catch.

Something terrible has to happen.

You couldn't...

...live with yourself if you didn't try to stop it, but...

What are you talking about?

It's just... The life you know...

...all the stuff that you take for granted...

...it's not gonna last.

Mike Kripke.

Back there, why did you say "Kripke's basement"?

Because Mike Kripke's house...

...that's where the kids used to go make out, right?

So you and me... Wait, did we...?

Holy shit, we did.

We made out in Kripke's basement. I cannot believe you remembered that.

I must have made some kind of impression.

Give me a break.

I only remembered because the next day you were in the news.

Wait a second. You and me hooked up the day before I first met him.

And now again,    years later.

We were supposed to meet.

Coincidence.

Yeah.

Hon? Did you just get in?

Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D. This is Detective Bell.

We're looking for Katherine Brewster. Is she here?

No.

You're her fianc√©, Scott Mason?  Yes.

There was an incident at the veterinary hospital where she works.

We're concerned something may have happened to her.

Where is she?

We got a report from a gas station attendant near Victorville...

...about a possible kidnapping and it might be related.

I'll help you find her.

Come with me.

Go.

Your mother?

I never even knew where she was buried.

I hit the road the day she died.

Why did you bring me here?

No! What are you doing?

Hey, stop!

Get away from it! Stop!

Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico.

Her friends scattered her ashes in the sea.

They stored these weapons in accordance with her will.

What happened to her?

Leukaemia.

I'm sorry.

We were living in Baja when she was diagnosed.

They only gave her six months.

But she fought for three years.

Long enough to make sure.

To make sure?

That the world didn't end.

"Every day after this one is a gift."

She told me, "We made it. We're free."

But I never really believed that.

I guess she didn't either.

You know you were about the closest thing to a father I ever had?

How pathetic is that?

Out of my way!

My mission is to protect you.

That's enough.

Move or I'll do it! I swear I will! I'll shoot you!

Go ahead. See what happens.

Don't do that.

Oh, my God.

This is the police.  We have the building surrounded.

Release your hostage!

Just leave me here. I'm not the one you want. You're wasting your time.

Incorrect. John Connor leads the Resistance to victory.

How?

Why? Why me?

You are John Connor.

Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit since the cradle.

Look at me. I'm no leader, I never was!

I'm never gonna...

Let go.

You're right. You're not the one I want.

I'm wasting my time.

Fuck you, you fucking machine!

Better.

Oh, you were just dicking with me?

Anger is more useful than despair.

What?

Basic psychology is among my subroutines.

Perps still holed up?

Gotcha.

Good news. Your fianc√©e's okay.

Where is she?

Greenlawn Cemetery, up off the   freeway.

It's right by the desert. But they're gonna bring her back to the...

Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.

I'm a posttrauma counsellor for the sheriff's department.

How are you feeling?

He's not human.

He's really not human.

I know what it's like to be in a hostage situation.

I've been there myself.

The fear, the adrenaline.

You find yourself imagining things.

Impossible things.

Crazy things.

Insane things.

Take years to get over it.

Go, go, go!  Move it!

Drop your weapon!

And the coffin!

Take him down! Take him down!

Resume fire!

We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.

Why? What makes her so goddamn important?

Through her, you contact remnants of the military...

...and learn how to fight Skynet, forming the core of the Resistance.

Later, your children will become important.

What?  She's your wife.

Get in!

Do you want to live? Come on!

It was Scott! How could it be Scott?  Your fianc√©?

The TX is polymimetic, able to take the form of anything it touches.

Your fianc√© is dead.

Oh, my God!

Do something!

Get down.

We need a new vehicle.

Hey, come on.

We gotta keep moving.

She killed Scott because of me.

Look, I know this won't help...

...but sometimes things happen that we just can't change.

It's not your fault.

Are you sure about this?

About her and me, I mean.

Your confusion is not rational. She's a healthy female of breeding age.

There's more to it than that.

My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bonding.

So this Terminatrix, how many others does she have on her hit list?

Twentytwo. Anderson, Elizabeth. Anderson, William.

Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

My father?

Having failed to acquire its primary target...

...TX will resume its default program.

She's gonna kill my father too?  There's a high probability.

No.  Who is he? What does he do?

He's in the Air Force. Weapon design, secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

General Robert Brewster is program director of CRS...

...Cyber Research Systems, autonomous weapons division.

Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

Skynet is one of the digital defence systems developed under Brewster.

Oh, God.

Oh, my God. Of course.

It all makes sense now.

If you hadn't come back when I was a kid, changed everything...

...we would have gotten together then. I would have met her father.

Don't you see?  I don't understand.

Your father. This is all about your father.

He's the key. He always was.

Your father is the one who can shut Skynet down.

He's the only one who ever could.

We have to get to him before the TX does.

Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission.

This is your mission, to save people!

My mission is to ensure the survival of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

I am giving you an order.

I am not programmed to follow your orders.

After the nuclear war, you both...  Nuclear war?!

There doesn't have to be a war! We can stop it!

There is insufficient time.

The first launch sequences will be initiated at  :   p.m.

What, today?  Affirmative.

John, what is he saying?

Judgment Day.

The end of the world.

It's today, three hours from now.

Two hours and    minutes.

We must continue south into Mexico to escape the primary blast zones.

No, we have to get to her dad.

The Mojave area will sustain significant nuclear fallout.

You will not survive.

You mean we go hide somewhere in a hole while the bombs fall?

It is your destiny.

Fuck my destiny.  John.

You cannot selfterminate.

No, you can't. I can do whatever I want.

I'm a human being. I'm not some goddamn robot.

Cybernetic organism.  Whatever!

Either we get her father to shut Skynet down...

...stop this shit from ever happening, or so much for the great John Connor.

Because your future, my destiny, I don't want any part of it. I never did.

Based on your pupil dilation, skin temperature and motor functions...

...I calculate an   % probability that you will not pull the trigger.

Please do what he says. You have to save my father!

We can reach CRS in approximately one hour...

...depending on traffic conditions.

I can't get a line.

The whole cell network is down.

Skynet is assuming control over global communications...

...in preparation for its attack.

So if this war is between people and machines...

...why are you on our side?

The Resistance captured me and reprogrammed my CPU.

I was originally designed for assassination missions.

So...

...you don't really care if this mission succeeds or not.

If we get killed, does that mean anything to you?

If you were to die, I will become useless.

There will be no reason for me to exist.

Thank you for doing this.

Your gratitude is not required.

I am programmed to follow your commands.

Her commands?

Katherine Brewster had me reactivated...

...and sent through the time displacement field.

What exactly am I in this future of yours?

You're John Connor's spouse and secondincommand.

No, I...

What?

You're a mess.

Hey, you're not exactly my type, either.

Why didn't I send you back?

I am not authorized to answer your question.

Why didn't he send you back?  He was dead.

Well, that sucks.

Humans inevitably die.  Yeah, I know.

So how does it...? No.

Maybe I don't want to know.

How does he die?

John Connor was terminated on July  th,     .

I was selected for the emotional attachment he had for my model...

...due to his boyhood experiences. This aided in my infiltration.

What are you saying?

I killed you.

This has to be a mistake. As of      all military systems were secure.

They were. Only the civilian sector was affected. Internet, air traffic.

Minutes ago, guidance computers at Vandenberg crashed.

We thought it was an error. It looks like the virus.

Early warning in Alaska is down.  Satellite signals are scrambled.

What about the missile silos, the subs?

We've lost contact.

You're saying this country is completely open to attack.

Theoretically, we could be under attack already.

Who's doing this? A foreign power or some computer hacker in his garage?

We can't trace the virus or pin it down.

It keeps growing and changing, like it has a mind of its own.

This can't be happening.

The Pentagon's on the secure line. It's the chairman.

All right.

Look...

...none of this is gonna happen.

We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

He won't have to kill me someday.

He'll never even exist.

You and I, we can just go our separate ways.

You know, Mike Kripke's basement...

That was the first time I ever kissed a guy.

Really?

Your levity is good.

It relieves tension and the fear of death.

 We're hoping you have  a solution for us.

I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready for a systemwide connection.

 That's not what your civilian  counterparts there told me.

 They say we can stop  this damn virus.

 I understand there's a certain amount  of performance anxiety...

 ... but your boys say if we plug Skynet  into all of our systems...

 ... it'll squash this thing and give me  back control of my military.

Mr. Chairman, I need to make myself very clear.

If we uplink now, Skynet will be in control of your military.

 But you'll be in control  of Skynet, right?

That is correct, sir.

 Then do it.

 And, Brewster, if this thing works...

 ... you'll get all the funding  you'll ever need.

Yes, sir.

Sir?

Shall I?

No.

It's my job now.

  Skynet Defence System activated.  We're in.

We're past the firewalls, local defence nets, Minutemen, subs.

Skynet's fully operational, processing at    teraflops a second.

It should take less than a minute to find the virus and kill it.

Let's pray to God this works.

Power failure?

No. I don't know what it is.

What the hell is going on?

Daddy!

What are you doing here?

Daddy! Get away from it!

Watch out!

Daddy, don't move.

She'll be back.

We have to shut down Skynet.

Where's the system core? In this building?

Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

Skynet is the virus! It's why everything's falling apart!

Skynet has become selfaware.

In one hour it will initiate a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

What enemy?

Us!

Humans.

Oh, God! It's the machines. They're starting to take over.

My office, on this floor, we have to get there.

The access codes are in my safe.

 Why are they killing everyone?  To destroy any threat to Skynet.

Which ones are the codes?

Red envelope.

Crystal Peak. You have to get to Crystal Peak.

 What is he saying?  Crystal Peak.

A hardened facility in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Fiftytwo miles northeast, bearing  .  degrees.

That's the system core?

It's your only chance.

You'll need a plane. The particle accelerator leads to the runway.

Take care of my daughter.

Oh, Katie, I am sorry.

I opened Pandora's box.

Get down!

There's nothing you can do. Come on.

We must go. It is not safe here.

Kate, we have to go.

Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

He wanted us to shut Skynet down. Come on.

Come on.

Run!

Let's go.

That's it. We can follow it out to the runway.

Come on.

What?

Nothing.

You remind me of my mother.

Oh, God. She's coming.

What are you doing?

Powering up.

Come on.

It's working.

Just die, you bitch!

Come on.

There's my father's plane. I trained on it.

Yes! He made it.

Get away from me.

Leave!

Now!

Let's go!

 The master's on. Throttle's set.  Come on. Let's go.

Oh, please. You can't do this.

I have no choice.

The TX...

...has corrupted my system.

You can't kill a human being. You said so yourself.

Let him go!

You're fighting it right now.

My CPU is intact.

But I cannot control my other functions.

You don't have to do this. You don't want to do this!

Desire is irrelevant.

I am a machine.

What is your mission?

To ensure the survival of John Connor...

...and Katherine Brewster.

You are about to fail that mission!

I can... I cannot.

You know what you have to do.

You know my destiny.

I have to live.

 Are you okay?  What happened?

He couldn't do it. He shut himself down.

 Can you fly?  Yeah.

Okay.     degrees...

...   miles, our max air speed is about    .

We've got    minutes.

It's just you and me now.

What if we can't stop it?

There's enough C  here to take out    supercomputers.

We're gonna make it, Kate.

The future is up to us.

That's gotta be it.

Skynet. There may be more of them.

Come on.

I think this is some kind of blast door.

There's no way we can blow through this thing.

John, look.

Now what?

It's a code prompt.

Type in "Dakota    ".

"Red    ".

Come on! We gotta get this thing open.

Here. It's "Avalon    ".

Put it in!

Come on!

I'm back.

Go! Now!

Come on!

 Thank you.  We'll meet again.

Go!

Come on!

You are terminated.

The elevator.

I'll set the detonator for five minutes.

That should give us enough time to get back up.

What is this place?

These computers are    years old.

This isn't Skynet.

There's nothing here.

This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.

Only they never got the warning.

Goddamn it!

There's nothing here!

Why didn't he tell us?

Why did he lead us down here?

To live.

That was his mission.

There was never any stopping it.

John...

...we could just...

...let it go.

 Hello?

 Hello? Can somebody hear me?

This is Montana Civil Defence.

 Somebody please come in.

 Is there anybody there?

 Anyone reading me? Over.

 Rumours about a launch sequence.

 Command and control  have broken down.

 Is anyone receiving me?  Somebody?

 Somebody please come in.

 Anybody out there?

  SAC Nellis. We're under attack.   CQ? CQ?

 Is anybody there?

This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

 Connor? What the hell is happening?  Who's in charge there?

I am.

 Connor, can you help us?

 This is Montana Civil Defence.  Where did you say you were again?

 By the time Skynet  became self-aware...

 ... it had spread into millions of  computer servers across the planet.

 Ordinary computers in office  buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere.

 It was software in cyberspace.

 There was no system core.  It could not be shut down.

 The attack began,  just as he said it would.

 Judgment Day.

 The day the human race  was nearly destroyed...

 ... by weapons they'd built to protect themselves.

 I should have realized our destiny  was never to stop Judgment Day.

 It was merely to survive it...

 ... together.

 The Terminator knew.

 He tried to tell us...

 ... but I didn't want to hear it.

 Maybe the future has been written.  I don't know.

 All I know is what  the Terminator taught me:

 Never stop fighting.

 And I never will.

 The battle has just begun.






The future has not been written.

There is no fate but what  we make for ourselves.

I wish I could believe that.

My name is John Connor.

They tried to murder me  before I was born.

When I was    they tried again.

Machines from the future.

Terminators.

All my life, my mother told me  the storm was coming.

Judgment Day.  Connor!

The beginning of a war  between man and machines.

Three billion lives  would vanish in an instant.

And I would lead what was left  of the human race to ultimate victory.

It hasn't happened.

No bombs fell.

Computers didn't take control.

We stopped Judgment Day.

I should feel safe...

... but I don't.

So I live off the grid.

No phone, no address.

No one and nothing can find me.

I've erased all connections  to the past.

But as hard as I try...

... I can't erase my dreams...

... my nightmares.

I feel the weight of the future  bearing down on me.

A future I don't want.

So I keep running...

... as fast as I can.

Anywhere.

Nowhere.

Oh, my God.

Are you okay?

Do you want me to call    ?

I like this car.

What are you...?

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

Slow down and pull over immediately.

Lady, have you any idea how fast you were going?

Let me see your license and registration.

I like your gun.

What?

This stupid thing's not working.

What's wrong with this thing?

I hate machines.

Hello?   Kate, it's your father.

You're blowing me off again.

I'm so sorry. You know how much I wanted to see you this weekend.

We're having computer problems...  I know, you can't talk about it.

It's just...

...Scott was really looking forward to this.

Katie. I wish I had more time  to get to know him. I really do.

That's okay. You're bound to run into him at the wedding.

Please. I'm still in a state of denial about that.

You're not the only one.   Hey, kiddo.

You don't need me to pass judgment on this guy.

You've done the right thing your whole life.

You won't make a mistake.  You never do.

I'm the luckiest father  in the world, you know?

I've never had to be afraid for my daughter.

Listen, I hate this. I gotta run. Come  see me. I promise I won't cancel.

We will.

Bye, Dad, I love you.  Love you too.

Okay, what have we got?  This new computer virus is tricky.

It's infected half the civilian Internet as well as secondary military apps.

Payroll, inventory.  Primary defence nets are still clean?

So far the firewalls are holding up.

Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use our Al to scan the infrastructure.

Search and destroy for any hint of the virus.

I know, Tony, but that's like going after a fly with a bazooka.

Once the connection's made, it should only be a few minutes.

During which we put everything under the control of one computer system.

The most intelligent system ever conceived.

I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.

I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

Yes, sir.

Thanks.

You're supposed to go around to the back.

Hey, I said you're supposed to go...

Take off your clothes.  Patience, honey.

Bitch. Wait your turn.

Your clothes.  Talk to the hand.

Now.

Welcome to Jim's Burgers.  Can I take your order?

Jose Barrera?   Yeah, that's me.

Growing concern over widespread  outages in the global digital network...

... have prompted rumours  of a new computer supervirus.

Wall Street analysts are confident...  Shit! My mom's home.

Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer. Here. Take that.

Go, go, go.

Elizabeth and William Anderson?

I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs. Is there something wrong?

What's going on?

I have to go to the clinic. It's an emergency.

It's  :   in the morning.

Well, I'll be back before you get up.

Cool it, guys, it's just me.

We've got a sick cat coming in.

Great.

Junkies.

Please, don't do that.

I suppose it was you who ripped us off last week.

Put the phone down.

Sorry.

I just...

I needed some medicine.

There's an emergency clinic half a mile away.

Can't do that.

How much did you take?

Enough.  Well...

...this is the stuff we use to chemically neuter dogs.

Take a look.

Hey!

Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

Next time bring a clue, not a paintball gun.

No, this isn't what you think.  Yeah, right.

I think Hercules has got pneumonia. He started coughing and won't stop.

Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.  A problem? This is an emergency!

It sounds like a hairball.  I know what a hairball sounds like.

Where's Dr. Monroe?  It's  :   in the morning.

I'm sure he's home sleeping. He'll come in if he has to.

Just wait in here with Hercules and I'll be a few minutes, all right?

Mike Kripke's basement.

What? What does that mean?

You're John Connor.

I'm Kate Brewster.

We went to West Hills Junior High together.

Jesus.  What happened to you, John?

Middle of eighth grade, you just disappeared.

And there was that thing about your foster parents.

Yeah, they were murdered.

I didn't do it.

What the hell?

Is somebody with you?

Katherine Brewster?

No.

John Connor was here. Where did he go?

Tell me. Where did he go?

Katherine Brewster?

What are you doing? Let me down!

Let me down! Let me down!

Where is John Connor?

If I tell you, will you let me go?

Yes.

He's...

...in the kennel, in a cage.

You said that you'd let me go.

I lied.

Please, please, please. You have to let me go!

John Connor.

It is time.

You here to kill me?

No. You must live.

Why are you here?

Where are we going?  Keep moving.

Get out of here.

Now!

No pulse.  See if you can get him down.

I can't.

This guy weighs a ton.

   .  Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

Where are you now?  I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

It's a Toyota Tundra.

It says "Emery Animal Hospital" on the side. I'm locked inside the back.

Hello?

Hello?

Shit! Shit!

Get off.

Let me out!

What are you doing here?

You tell me. You got me into this.

Stop the car.  I can't. Not yet.

You bastard! Stop the car!  Shut up!

Son of a bitch.

Goddamn it.

Look what you did to my car.

This is my company car, asshole.

Get your ass out here.

Get your ass out of the car. Now!

What are you doing?

If you don't have insurance, I'm gonna rip your balls off.

I don't want any problems, okay?  Shut up!

Help!

Who's talking back there? What's going on?

Calm down.  Shut up!

I'm being kidnapped! Call the police!  Well, I'll be goddamned.

Call    !  A cop when you need one.

Help, please! Please!

Let me out of here! Help!

Get back here, asshole!

That's the cops! You have to pull over!

Yeah, first chance I get.

Hold on!

Stop it!

I'll drive.

Get out.

Excuse me.

Move over.

No sign of brain trauma.

Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

Do you even remember me?

Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne?

"Hasta la vista, baby." Ring any bells?

That was a different T   .

What, do you come off an assembly line or something?

Exactly.

Oh, man. I'm gonna have to teach you everything all over again.

Katherine Brewster, have you sustained injury?

Drop dead, you asshole!

I'm unable to comply.

Where are you taking me?

To a safe location.

All right, get off at the next exit. Let her out.

Negative. Katherine Brewster must be protected.

I thought they were after me.  You could not be located.

So a TX was sent back through time to eliminate your lieutenants.

So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

No, no. No, you shouldn't even exist.

I mean, we took out Cyberdyne over    years ago.

We stopped Judgment Day.  You only postponed it.

Judgment Day is inevitable.

I require a cutting tool.

Here, take the wheel.

What are you doing?  I am powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

My primary cell was damaged by a plasma attack.

TX is designed for extreme combat, driven by a plasma reactor...

...and equipped with onboard weapons.

Its arsenal includes...

...nanotechnological transjectors.

Meaning?  It can control other machines.

Its body chassis is heavily armoured and hardened to withstand attack.

You'll find a way to destroy her.  Unlikely.

I'm an obsolete design.

TX is faster, more powerful and more intelligent.

It's a far more effective killing machine.

Oh, great.

That's great.

My presence in this timeline has been anticipated.

TX is designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms.

So she's an antiTerminator Terminator?

You've gotta be shitting me.

No, I am not shitting you.

When ruptured, the fuel cells become unstable.

Relax.

Let me out of here!  Relax!

Man, this is wack.

It's been like this for hours. Every goddamn station.

Hey.

Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

Talk to the hand.

Help! Help me!

Help!

I think we better go.

Jerky?

You're kidnapping me.

Look...  God, you were always a delinquent.

And look at you now, sitting there like the badboy thing still works.

What are you, some kind of gang member?

How do you live with yourself?

What?

Tell her who I am.

John Connor is leader of the Worldwide Resistance...

...and last hope of humankind.

Right. And him?

He's a robot from the future.

Living tissue over a metal skeleton, sent back in time to protect me.

Go to hell.

He doesn't mean you any harm.

I have a fianc√©.

He's gonna be looking for me.

What is it that you want?

Just...

...imagine...

...if you knew you were gonna do something important with your life.

Something amazing.

Maybe the most important thing anyone has ever done.

But there's a catch.

Something terrible has to happen.

You couldn't...

...live with yourself if you didn't try to stop it, but...

What are you talking about?

It's just... The life you know...

...all the stuff that you take for granted...

...it's not gonna last.

Mike Kripke.

Back there, why did you say "Kripke's basement"?

Because Mike Kripke's house...

...that's where the kids used to go make out, right?

So you and me... Wait, did we...?

Holy shit, we did.

We made out in Kripke's basement. I cannot believe you remembered that.

I must have made some kind of impression.

Give me a break.

I only remembered because the next day you were in the news.

Wait a second. You and me hooked up the day before I first met him.

And now again,    years later.

We were supposed to meet.

Coincidence.

Yeah.

Hon? Did you just get in?

Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D. This is Detective Bell.

We're looking for Katherine Brewster. Is she here?

No.

You're her fianc√©, Scott Mason?  Yes.

There was an incident at the veterinary hospital where she works.

We're concerned something may have happened to her.

Where is she?

We got a report from a gas station attendant near Victorville...

...about a possible kidnapping and it might be related.

I'll help you find her.

Come with me.

Go.

Your mother?

I never even knew where she was buried.

I hit the road the day she died.

Why did you bring me here?

No! What are you doing?

Hey, stop!

Get away from it! Stop!

Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico.

Her friends scattered her ashes in the sea.

They stored these weapons in accordance with her will.

What happened to her?

Leukaemia.

I'm sorry.

We were living in Baja when she was diagnosed.

They only gave her six months.

But she fought for three years.

Long enough to make sure.

To make sure?

That the world didn't end.

"Every day after this one is a gift."

She told me, "We made it. We're free."

But I never really believed that.

I guess she didn't either.

You know you were about the closest thing to a father I ever had?

How pathetic is that?

Out of my way!

My mission is to protect you.

That's enough.

Move or I'll do it! I swear I will! I'll shoot you!

Go ahead. See what happens.

Don't do that.

Oh, my God.

This is the police.  We have the building surrounded.

Release your hostage!

Just leave me here. I'm not the one you want. You're wasting your time.

Incorrect. John Connor leads the Resistance to victory.

How?

Why? Why me?

You are John Connor.

Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit since the cradle.

Look at me. I'm no leader, I never was!

I'm never gonna...

Let go.

You're right. You're not the one I want.

I'm wasting my time.

Fuck you, you fucking machine!

Better.

Oh, you were just dicking with me?

Anger is more useful than despair.

What?

Basic psychology is among my subroutines.

Perps still holed up?

Gotcha.

Good news. Your fianc√©e's okay.

Where is she?

Greenlawn Cemetery, up off the   freeway.

It's right by the desert. But they're gonna bring her back to the...

Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.

I'm a posttrauma counsellor for the sheriff's department.

How are you feeling?

He's not human.

He's really not human.

I know what it's like to be in a hostage situation.

I've been there myself.

The fear, the adrenaline.

You find yourself imagining things.

Impossible things.

Crazy things.

Insane things.

Take years to get over it.

Go, go, go!  Move it!

Drop your weapon!

And the coffin!

Take him down! Take him down!

Resume fire!

We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.

Why? What makes her so goddamn important?

Through her, you contact remnants of the military...

...and learn how to fight Skynet, forming the core of the Resistance.

Later, your children will become important.

What?  She's your wife.

Get in!

Do you want to live? Come on!

It was Scott! How could it be Scott?  Your fianc√©?

The TX is polymimetic, able to take the form of anything it touches.

Your fianc√© is dead.

Oh, my God!

Do something!

Get down.

We need a new vehicle.

Hey, come on.

We gotta keep moving.

She killed Scott because of me.

Look, I know this won't help...

...but sometimes things happen that we just can't change.

It's not your fault.

Are you sure about this?

About her and me, I mean.

Your confusion is not rational. She's a healthy female of breeding age.

There's more to it than that.

My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bonding.

So this Terminatrix, how many others does she have on her hit list?

Twentytwo. Anderson, Elizabeth. Anderson, William.

Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

My father?

Having failed to acquire its primary target...

...TX will resume its default program.

She's gonna kill my father too?  There's a high probability.

No.  Who is he? What does he do?

He's in the Air Force. Weapon design, secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

General Robert Brewster is program director of CRS...

...Cyber Research Systems, autonomous weapons division.

Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

Skynet is one of the digital defence systems developed under Brewster.

Oh, God.

Oh, my God. Of course.

It all makes sense now.

If you hadn't come back when I was a kid, changed everything...

...we would have gotten together then. I would have met her father.

Don't you see?  I don't understand.

Your father. This is all about your father.

He's the key. He always was.

Your father is the one who can shut Skynet down.

He's the only one who ever could.

We have to get to him before the TX does.

Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission.

This is your mission, to save people!

My mission is to ensure the survival of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

I am giving you an order.

I am not programmed to follow your orders.

After the nuclear war, you both...  Nuclear war?!

There doesn't have to be a war! We can stop it!

There is insufficient time.

The first launch sequences will be initiated at  :   p.m.

What, today?  Affirmative.

John, what is he saying?

Judgment Day.

The end of the world.

It's today, three hours from now.

Two hours and    minutes.

We must continue south into Mexico to escape the primary blast zones.

No, we have to get to her dad.

The Mojave area will sustain significant nuclear fallout.

You will not survive.

You mean we go hide somewhere in a hole while the bombs fall?

It is your destiny.

Fuck my destiny.  John.

You cannot selfterminate.

No, you can't. I can do whatever I want.

I'm a human being. I'm not some goddamn robot.

Cybernetic organism.  Whatever!

Either we get her father to shut Skynet down...

...stop this shit from ever happening, or so much for the great John Connor.

Because your future, my destiny, I don't want any part of it. I never did.

Based on your pupil dilation, skin temperature and motor functions...

...I calculate an   % probability that you will not pull the trigger.

Please do what he says. You have to save my father!

We can reach CRS in approximately one hour...

...depending on traffic conditions.

I can't get a line.

The whole cell network is down.

Skynet is assuming control over global communications...

...in preparation for its attack.

So if this war is between people and machines...

...why are you on our side?

The Resistance captured me and reprogrammed my CPU.

I was originally designed for assassination missions.

So...

...you don't really care if this mission succeeds or not.

If we get killed, does that mean anything to you?

If you were to die, I will become useless.

There will be no reason for me to exist.

Thank you for doing this.

Your gratitude is not required.

I am programmed to follow your commands.

Her commands?

Katherine Brewster had me reactivated...

...and sent through the time displacement field.

What exactly am I in this future of yours?

You're John Connor's spouse and secondincommand.

No, I...

What?

You're a mess.

Hey, you're not exactly my type, either.

Why didn't I send you back?

I am not authorized to answer your question.

Why didn't he send you back?  He was dead.

Well, that sucks.

Humans inevitably die.  Yeah, I know.

So how does it...? No.

Maybe I don't want to know.

How does he die?

John Connor was terminated on July  th,     .

I was selected for the emotional attachment he had for my model...

...due to his boyhood experiences. This aided in my infiltration.

What are you saying?

I killed you.

This has to be a mistake. As of      all military systems were secure.

They were. Only the civilian sector was affected. Internet, air traffic.

Minutes ago, guidance computers at Vandenberg crashed.

We thought it was an error. It looks like the virus.

Early warning in Alaska is down.  Satellite signals are scrambled.

What about the missile silos, the subs?

We've lost contact.

You're saying this country is completely open to attack.

Theoretically, we could be under attack already.

Who's doing this? A foreign power or some computer hacker in his garage?

We can't trace the virus or pin it down.

It keeps growing and changing, like it has a mind of its own.

This can't be happening.

The Pentagon's on the secure line. It's the chairman.

All right.

Look...

...none of this is gonna happen.

We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

He won't have to kill me someday.

He'll never even exist.

You and I, we can just go our separate ways.

You know, Mike Kripke's basement...

That was the first time I ever kissed a guy.

Really?

Your levity is good.

It relieves tension and the fear of death.

 We're hoping you have  a solution for us.

I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready for a systemwide connection.

 That's not what your civilian  counterparts there told me.

 They say we can stop  this damn virus.

 I understand there's a certain amount  of performance anxiety...

 ... but your boys say if we plug Skynet  into all of our systems...

 ... it'll squash this thing and give me  back control of my military.

Mr. Chairman, I need to make myself very clear.

If we uplink now, Skynet will be in control of your military.

 But you'll be in control  of Skynet, right?

That is correct, sir.

 Then do it.

 And, Brewster, if this thing works...

 ... you'll get all the funding  you'll ever need.

Yes, sir.

Sir?

Shall I?

No.

It's my job now.

  Skynet Defence System activated.  We're in.

We're past the firewalls, local defence nets, Minutemen, subs.

Skynet's fully operational, processing at    teraflops a second.

It should take less than a minute to find the virus and kill it.

Let's pray to God this works.

Power failure?

No. I don't know what it is.

What the hell is going on?

Daddy!

What are you doing here?

Daddy! Get away from it!

Watch out!

Daddy, don't move.

She'll be back.

We have to shut down Skynet.

Where's the system core? In this building?

Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

Skynet is the virus! It's why everything's falling apart!

Skynet has become selfaware.

In one hour it will initiate a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

What enemy?

Us!

Humans.

Oh, God! It's the machines. They're starting to take over.

My office, on this floor, we have to get there.

The access codes are in my safe.

 Why are they killing everyone?  To destroy any threat to Skynet.

Which ones are the codes?

Red envelope.

Crystal Peak. You have to get to Crystal Peak.

 What is he saying?  Crystal Peak.

A hardened facility in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Fiftytwo miles northeast, bearing  .  degrees.

That's the system core?

It's your only chance.

You'll need a plane. The particle accelerator leads to the runway.

Take care of my daughter.

Oh, Katie, I am sorry.

I opened Pandora's box.

Get down!

There's nothing you can do. Come on.

We must go. It is not safe here.

Kate, we have to go.

Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

He wanted us to shut Skynet down. Come on.

Come on.

Run!

Let's go.

That's it. We can follow it out to the runway.

Come on.

What?

Nothing.

You remind me of my mother.

Oh, God. She's coming.

What are you doing?

Powering up.

Come on.

It's working.

Just die, you bitch!

Come on.

There's my father's plane. I trained on it.

Yes! He made it.

Get away from me.

Leave!

Now!

Let's go!

 The master's on. Throttle's set.  Come on. Let's go.

Oh, please. You can't do this.

I have no choice.

The TX...

...has corrupted my system.

You can't kill a human being. You said so yourself.

Let him go!

You're fighting it right now.

My CPU is intact.

But I cannot control my other functions.

You don't have to do this. You don't want to do this!

Desire is irrelevant.

I am a machine.

What is your mission?

To ensure the survival of John Connor...

...and Katherine Brewster.

You are about to fail that mission!

I can... I cannot.

You know what you have to do.

You know my destiny.

I have to live.

 Are you okay?  What happened?

He couldn't do it. He shut himself down.

 Can you fly?  Yeah.

Okay.     degrees...

...   miles, our max air speed is about    .

We've got    minutes.

It's just you and me now.

What if we can't stop it?

There's enough C  here to take out    supercomputers.

We're gonna make it, Kate.

The future is up to us.

That's gotta be it.

Skynet. There may be more of them.

Come on.

I think this is some kind of blast door.

There's no way we can blow through this thing.

John, look.

Now what?

It's a code prompt.

Type in "Dakota    ".

"Red    ".

Come on! We gotta get this thing open.

Here. It's "Avalon    ".

Put it in!

Come on!

I'm back.

Go! Now!

Come on!

 Thank you.  We'll meet again.

Go!

Come on!

You are terminated.

The elevator.

I'll set the detonator for five minutes.

That should give us enough time to get back up.

What is this place?

These computers are    years old.

This isn't Skynet.

There's nothing here.

This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.

Only they never got the warning.

Goddamn it!

There's nothing here!

Why didn't he tell us?

Why did he lead us down here?

To live.

That was his mission.

There was never any stopping it.

John...

...we could just...

...let it go.

 Hello?

 Hello? Can somebody hear me?

This is Montana Civil Defence.

 Somebody please come in.

 Is there anybody there?

 Anyone reading me? Over.

 Rumours about a launch sequence.

 Command and control  have broken down.

 Is anyone receiving me?  Somebody?

 Somebody please come in.

 Anybody out there?

  SAC Nellis. We're under attack.   CQ? CQ?

 Is anybody there?

This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

 Connor? What the hell is happening?  Who's in charge there?

I am.

 Connor, can you help us?

 This is Montana Civil Defence.  Where did you say you were again?

 By the time Skynet  became self-aware...

 ... it had spread into millions of  computer servers across the planet.

 Ordinary computers in office  buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere.

 It was software in cyberspace.

 There was no system core.  It could not be shut down.

 The attack began,  just as he said it would.

 Judgment Day.

 The day the human race  was nearly destroyed...

 ... by weapons they'd built to protect themselves.

 I should have realized our destiny  was never to stop Judgment Day.

 It was merely to survive it...

 ... together.

 The Terminator knew.

 He tried to tell us...

 ... but I didn't want to hear it.

 Maybe the future has been written.  I don't know.

 All I know is what  the Terminator taught me:

 Never stop fighting.

 And I never will.

 The battle has just begun.





I'm Reese, sergeant, TechCom DN38416 assigned to protect you. You've been targeted for termination...It's very important that you live....(The Terminator) He's not a man - a machine. A Terminator. A Cyberdyne Systems Model 101...Not a robot. A cyborg. A cybernetic organism...The Terminator's an infiltration unit, part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis - microprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough. But outside, it's living human tissue - flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs...The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new, they look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot...

Cyborgs don't feel pain, I do. Don't do that again. (Sarah: "Just let me go!") Listen, and understand! That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!

You set us up! It‚Äôs all bullshit, all of it! The Cabinet Minister, the whole business. Got us in here to do your dirty work. ‚Ä¶ shut up! Shut up! ‚Ä¶ So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder! What happened here Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust.

The usual. More money, more freedom, more air.

I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any second.

The chairman defended the attack, saying that space-based weapons are our only defense against the southern block's numerical superiority. And more violence last night on Mars where terrorists demanding independence once again halted the extraction of terbinium ore. Kuato and his so called freedom brigade claimed credit for this latest bombing, which attempted to reopen the sealed off Pyramid Mines. Mars military restored order with minimal use of force and all damage to the strategic facility was repaired within hours.

Conan! What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.

Oh, cookies! I can't wait to toss them.  
Someone you trust wants to talk to you. 
Who is it this time, my Mother?!  
I've seen a lot, but nothing would ever make me cut out my tongue.
If you yield only to a conqueror, then prepared to be conquered. 
Why don't they just call him Girl George?  
My name is Julius and I'm your TWIN brother. 
Oh obviously! The moment I sat down I though I was looking into a mirror. 
We're not identical twins.  
Can you hurry up. My horse is getting tired. 
You've seen those movies where they say  Make my day.  or  I'm your worst nightmare. , well listen to this one. Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers!
I'm going to throw up all over you. 
Go ahead... won't show on this shirt.  
What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!
If you drop your gun now, I promise I won't kill you. 
That's for sleeping with my wife! 
They're six year olds... how much trouble can they be?  
Your levity is good, it relieves tension and the fear of death.
Surprise, I'm your new cellmate. And I've come to make your life a living hell. Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter... has come at last. 
They even think I'm your girlfriend. 
Well we can straighten that out.. see this camera up there.. I can strangle you for the home audience.  
Capitalism! 
You're luggage! How do you Soviets deal with stress? Vodka 
Are these all your lunches? You mean you eat other peoples' lunches? STOP IT!!!
Leave anything for us? 
Just bodies. 
If it bleeds, we can kill it.  
Hey buddy you want a Turbo Man doll? 
Forget it, I'm not gonna sit on YOUR lap.  
When I die I will have to go before him. And he will ask me 'What is the riddle of steel?' And if I don't know he will cast me out of Valhalla and laugh at me! That's Crom! Strong on his mountain!  
Killian! Here's your Subzero! Now....plain zero! 
So the prince of darkness wants to conquer earth. He has to do it one hour before midnight. Is this eastern time?  
I know now why you cry, but it's something I can never do. To be, or not to be. 
Not to be.  
We'll take Cooke's car. He won't be needing it. 
No more complaining. No more 'Mr. Kimble, I have to go the bathroom'. Nothing! There is no bathroom!  
This isn't a plane, this is a canoe with wings! Then get in and start paddling. 
Benny!! Screw you!! 
The CIA got you pushing too many pencils? So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder.  
What happened? 
They caught a train.  
So who are you man? 
I'm the party pooper. 
When I said you should screw yourself. I didn't mean it literally.  
I suppose nothing hurts you. Only pain.  
It's as satisfying to me as, uh, coming is, you know? As, ah, having sex with a woman and coming. And so can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like, uh, getting the feeling of coming in a gym, I'm getting the feeling of coming at home, I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up, when I pose in front of 5,000 people, I get the same feeling, so I am coming day and night. I mean, it's terrific. Right? So you know, I am in heaven.  
If revenge is a dish best cold... then put on your Sunday's finest, it's time to feast!  
We had a difference of opinion. I thought my wife and daughter should live. He felt otherwise.  
Come with me if you want to live. 
What's the difference between you and I? 
The difference is, I'm just gonna kill you. 
What the hell are you?  
You're not sending me to the Cooler! 
You gotta be shitting me! 
No. I am not shitting you. 
You gotta be shitting me! 
I am not shitting you.  
Stop whining! You kids are soft. You lack discipline. 
You think you're funny, don't you? 
I know I am. I'm the famous comedian, Arnold Braunschweiger. 
Schwarzenegger! 
Gesundheit. 
Hey Claudius! You killed my father. Big mistake. 
Snakes?! Did you say snakes?!  
Don't break radio silence until they see me. 
How will I know? 
Because all fucking hell is going to break loose. 
The bridge is out!!!  
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 
Uplinks on the ground. Uplinks underground. You guys don't shut up, I'm going to uplink your ass... you'll be on the ground!  
Bucks? Doe? What is all this zoological talk about male and female animals? 
Fuck YOU, asshole!  
First I will turn Gotham into an icy graveyard. Then I will pull Batman's heart from his body and feel it freeze in my hand. 
Come on Cohagen. You got what you want. Give these people air!!  
What happened to Buzzsaw? 
Ahhh.. he had to split.  
Don't disturb my friend... he's dead tired. 
Crom. I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we fought and why we died. No, all that matter's is that two stood against many. That's what is important. Battle pleases you Crom. Grant me one request, grant me revenge. And if you do not listen, then to hell with you!  
Between your faith and my Glock nine millimeter, I'll take the Glock.  
A freeze is coming!  
Let off some steam, Bennett! 
You'd let me die here? No. That's the last thing that will happen to you. First, the air's gonna heat up in here to 451 degrees. than your pass will explode like a Roman candle, your socks will ignite, and your fingernails will melt.  
You should clone yourself while you‚Äôre still alive. 
So I can understand your unique perspective? 
No. So you can go fuck yourself!  
I love you too, sweetheart.
You scared mutha fucka! This green beret is going to kick your ass! 
I eat green berets for breakfast...and I am very hungry!  
Chill-out dickwad.  
Honey, you shouldn't drink and bake. 
Iced that guy!  
Where's Sully? 
I let him go.  
Nice night for a walk.  
I'm pregnant. 
What have you been feeding this thing? 
Blondes! 
Stick around! 
What the hell did you do to him?! 
I did nothing. The pavement was his enemy. 
You bastard! Drop dead! 
I don't do requests. 
It's called the Miranda act.. it says you can't even touch his ass. 
I do not want to touch his ass.. I want to make him talk!  
You want to be a farmer? Here's a couple of acres!  
First I'm gonna use you as a human shield, then I gonna take that chisel and kill the guard with it. Then I was thinking about breaking your neck.  
Milk are for babies, when you get older you drink beer.  
I promise not to kill anyone. 
He'll live. 
Get to the chopper!!  
Conan, what is best in life? 
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women! 
Consider this a divorce!  
I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.  
No, it's not a tumor. It's not a tumor! 
Oh, you think you're bad, huh? You're a fucking choir boy compared to me! A choir boy!!  
Get your ass to Mars
Fuck you, asshole.
Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last?
That's right, Matrix! You did!
I LIED!
Hasta la vista, baby.
You are one ugly motherfucker.
See you at the party, Richter!
I live to see you eat that contract! But I hope you leave enough room for my fist, because I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine!
Are you Sarah Conner?
Have you ever killed anyone?
Yes, but they were all bad!
I'll be back.
Nice night for a walk.
Nothing clean.  Right.
Your clothes.  Give them to me. Now. 
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
Wrong.
This is One-Four-Three.  West-bound on Olympic, approaching Overland.
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she is here.  Can I see her, please?
Where is she?
I'll come back. 
Fuck you, asshole.

Cyborgs don't feel pain, I do. Don't do that again. (Sarah: "Just let me go!") Listen, and understand! That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!

You set us up! It‚Äôs all bullshit, all of it! The Cabinet Minister, the whole business. Got us in here to do your dirty work. ‚Ä¶ shut up! Shut up! ‚Ä¶ So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder! What happened here Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust.

The usual. More money, more freedom, more air.

I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any second.

The chairman defended the attack, saying that space-based weapons are our only defense against the southern block's numerical superiority. And more violence last night on Mars where terrorists demanding independence once again halted the extraction of terbinium ore. Kuato and his so called freedom brigade claimed credit for this latest bombing, which attempted to reopen the sealed off Pyramid Mines. Mars military restored order with minimal use of force and all damage to the strategic facility was repaired within hours.

Conan! What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.

Oh, cookies! I can't wait to toss them.  
Someone you trust wants to talk to you. 
Who is it this time, my Mother?!  
I've seen a lot, but nothing would ever make me cut out my tongue.
If you yield only to a conqueror, then prepared to be conquered. 
Why don't they just call him Girl George?  
My name is Julius and I'm your TWIN brother. 
Oh obviously! The moment I sat down I though I was looking into a mirror. 
We're not identical twins.  
Can you hurry up. My horse is getting tired. 
You've seen those movies where they say  Make my day.  or  I'm your worst nightmare. , well listen to this one. Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers!
I'm going to throw up all over you. 
Go ahead... won't show on this shirt.  
What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!
If you drop your gun now, I promise I won't kill you. 
That's for sleeping with my wife! 
They're six year olds... how much trouble can they be?  
Your levity is good, it relieves tension and the fear of death.
Surprise, I'm your new cellmate. And I've come to make your life a living hell. Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter... has come at last. 
They even think I'm your girlfriend. 
Well we can straighten that out.. see this camera up there.. I can strangle you for the home audience.  
Capitalism! 
You're luggage! How do you Soviets deal with stress? Vodka 
Are these all your lunches? You mean you eat other peoples' lunches? STOP IT!!!
Leave anything for us? 
Just bodies. 
If it bleeds, we can kill it.  
Hey buddy you want a Turbo Man doll? 
Forget it, I'm not gonna sit on YOUR lap.  
When I die I will have to go before him. And he will ask me 'What is the riddle of steel?' And if I don't know he will cast me out of Valhalla and laugh at me! That's Crom! Strong on his mountain!  
Killian! Here's your Subzero! Now....plain zero! 
So the prince of darkness wants to conquer earth. He has to do it one hour before midnight. Is this eastern time?  
I know now why you cry, but it's something I can never do. To be, or not to be. 
Not to be.  
We'll take Cooke's car. He won't be needing it. 
No more complaining. No more 'Mr. Kimble, I have to go the bathroom'. Nothing! There is no bathroom!  
This isn't a plane, this is a canoe with wings! Then get in and start paddling. 
Benny!! Screw you!! 
The CIA got you pushing too many pencils? So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder.  
What happened? 
They caught a train.  
So who are you man? 
I'm the party pooper. 
When I said you should screw yourself. I didn't mean it literally.  
I suppose nothing hurts you. Only pain.  
It's as satisfying to me as, uh, coming is, you know? As, ah, having sex with a woman and coming. And so can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like, uh, getting the feeling of coming in a gym, I'm getting the feeling of coming at home, I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up, when I pose in front of 5,000 people, I get the same feeling, so I am coming day and night. I mean, it's terrific. Right? So you know, I am in heaven.  
If revenge is a dish best cold... then put on your Sunday's finest, it's time to feast!  
We had a difference of opinion. I thought my wife and daughter should live. He felt otherwise.  
Come with me if you want to live. 
What's the difference between you and I? 
The difference is, I'm just gonna kill you. 
What the hell are you?  
You're not sending me to the Cooler! 
You gotta be shitting me! 
No. I am not shitting you. 
You gotta be shitting me! 
I am not shitting you.  
Stop whining! You kids are soft. You lack discipline. 
You think you're funny, don't you? 
I know I am. I'm the famous comedian, Arnold Braunschweiger. 
Schwarzenegger! 
Gesundheit. 
Hey Claudius! You killed my father. Big mistake. 
Snakes?! Did you say snakes?!  
Don't break radio silence until they see me. 
How will I know? 
Because all fucking hell is going to break loose. 
The bridge is out!!!  
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 
Uplinks on the ground. Uplinks underground. You guys don't shut up, I'm going to uplink your ass... you'll be on the ground!  
Bucks? Doe? What is all this zoological talk about male and female animals? 
Fuck YOU, asshole!  
First I will turn Gotham into an icy graveyard. Then I will pull Batman's heart from his body and feel it freeze in my hand. 
Come on Cohagen. You got what you want. Give these people air!!  
What happened to Buzzsaw? 
Ahhh.. he had to split.  
Don't disturb my friend... he's dead tired. 
Crom. I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we fought and why we died. No, all that matter's is that two stood against many. That's what is important. Battle pleases you Crom. Grant me one request, grant me revenge. And if you do not listen, then to hell with you!  
Between your faith and my Glock nine millimeter, I'll take the Glock.  
A freeze is coming!  
Let off some steam, Bennett! 
You'd let me die here? No. That's the last thing that will happen to you. First, the air's gonna heat up in here to 451 degrees. than your pass will explode like a Roman candle, your socks will ignite, and your fingernails will melt.  
You should clone yourself while you‚Äôre still alive. 
So I can understand your unique perspective? 
No. So you can go fuck yourself!  
I love you too, sweetheart.
You scared mutha fucka! This green beret is going to kick your ass! 
I eat green berets for breakfast...and I am very hungry!  
Chill-out dickwad.  
Honey, you shouldn't drink and bake. 
Iced that guy!  
Where's Sully? 
I let him go.  
Nice night for a walk.  
I'm pregnant. 
What have you been feeding this thing? 
Blondes! 
Stick around! 
What the hell did you do to him?! 
I did nothing. The pavement was his enemy. 
You bastard! Drop dead! 
I don't do requests. 
It's called the Miranda act.. it says you can't even touch his ass. 
I do not want to touch his ass.. I want to make him talk!  
You want to be a farmer? Here's a couple of acres!  
First I'm gonna use you as a human shield, then I gonna take that chisel and kill the guard with it. Then I was thinking about breaking your neck.  
Milk are for babies, when you get older you drink beer.  
I promise not to kill anyone. 
He'll live. 
Get to the chopper!!  
Conan, what is best in life? 
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women! 
Consider this a divorce!  
I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.  
No, it's not a tumor. It's not a tumor! 
Oh, you think you're bad, huh? You're a fucking choir boy compared to me! A choir boy!!  
Get your ass to Mars
Fuck you, asshole.
Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last?
That's right, Matrix! You did!
I LIED!
Hasta la vista, baby.
You are one ugly motherfucker.
See you at the party, Richter!
I live to see you eat that contract! But I hope you leave enough room for my fist, because I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine!
Are you Sarah Conner?
Have you ever killed anyone?
Yes, but they were all bad!
I'll be back.
Nice night for a walk.
Nothing clean.  Right.
Your clothes.  Give them to me. Now. 
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
Wrong.
This is One-Four-Three.  West-bound on Olympic, approaching Overland.
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she is here.  Can I see her, please?
Where is she?
I'll come back. 
Fuck you, asshole.
Hello.
Tell me your address there.
I'm Reese, sergeant, TechCom DN38416 assigned to protect you. You've been targeted for termination...It's very important that you live....(The Terminator) He's not a man - a machine. A Terminator. A Cyberdyne Systems Model 101...Not a robot. A cyborg. A cybernetic organism...The Terminator's an infiltration unit, part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis - microprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough. But outside, it's living human tissue - flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs...The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new, they look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot...

Cyborgs don't feel pain, I do. Don't do that again. (Sarah: "Just let me go!") Listen, and understand! That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!

Conan! What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.


The future has not been written.

There is no fate but what  we make for ourselves.

I wish I could believe that.

My name is John Connor.

They tried to murder me  before I was born.

When I was    they tried again.

Machines from the future.

Terminators.

All my life, my mother told me  the storm was coming.

Judgment Day.  Connor!

The beginning of a war  between man and machines.

Three billion lives  would vanish in an instant.

And I would lead what was left  of the human race to ultimate victory.

It hasn't happened.

No bombs fell.

Computers didn't take control.

We stopped Judgment Day.

I should feel safe...

... but I don't.

So I live off the grid.

No phone, no address.

No one and nothing can find me.

I've erased all connections  to the past.

But as hard as I try...

... I can't erase my dreams...

... my nightmares.

I feel the weight of the future  bearing down on me.

A future I don't want.

So I keep running...

... as fast as I can.

Anywhere.

Nowhere.

Oh, my God.

Are you okay?

Do you want me to call    ?

I like this car.

What are you...?

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

Slow down and pull over immediately.

Lady, have you any idea how fast you were going?

Let me see your license and registration.

I like your gun.

What?

This stupid thing's not working.

What's wrong with this thing?

I hate machines.

Hello?   Kate, it's your father.

You're blowing me off again.

I'm so sorry. You know how much I wanted to see you this weekend.

We're having computer problems...  I know, you can't talk about it.

It's just...

...Scott was really looking forward to this.

Katie. I wish I had more time  to get to know him. I really do.

That's okay. You're bound to run into him at the wedding.

Please. I'm still in a state of denial about that.

You're not the only one.   Hey, kiddo.

You don't need me to pass judgment on this guy.

You've done the right thing your whole life.

You won't make a mistake.  You never do.

I'm the luckiest father  in the world, you know?

I've never had to be afraid for my daughter.

Listen, I hate this. I gotta run. Come  see me. I promise I won't cancel.

We will.

Bye, Dad, I love you.  Love you too.

Okay, what have we got?  This new computer virus is tricky.

It's infected half the civilian Internet as well as secondary military apps.

Payroll, inventory.  Primary defence nets are still clean?

So far the firewalls are holding up.

Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use our Al to scan the infrastructure.

Search and destroy for any hint of the virus.

I know, Tony, but that's like going after a fly with a bazooka.

Once the connection's made, it should only be a few minutes.

During which we put everything under the control of one computer system.

The most intelligent system ever conceived.

I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.

I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

Yes, sir.

Thanks.

You're supposed to go around to the back.

Hey, I said you're supposed to go...

Take off your clothes.  Patience, honey.

Bitch. Wait your turn.

Your clothes.  Talk to the hand.

Now.

Welcome to Jim's Burgers.  Can I take your order?

Jose Barrera?   Yeah, that's me.

Growing concern over widespread  outages in the global digital network...

... have prompted rumours  of a new computer supervirus.

Wall Street analysts are confident...  Shit! My mom's home.

Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer. Here. Take that.

Go, go, go.

Elizabeth and William Anderson?

I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs. Is there something wrong?

What's going on?

I have to go to the clinic. It's an emergency.

It's  :   in the morning.

Well, I'll be back before you get up.

Cool it, guys, it's just me.

We've got a sick cat coming in.

Great.

Junkies.

Please, don't do that.

I suppose it was you who ripped us off last week.

Put the phone down.

Sorry.

I just...

I needed some medicine.

There's an emergency clinic half a mile away.

Can't do that.

How much did you take?

Enough.  Well...

...this is the stuff we use to chemically neuter dogs.

Take a look.

Hey!

Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

Next time bring a clue, not a paintball gun.

No, this isn't what you think.  Yeah, right.

I think Hercules has got pneumonia. He started coughing and won't stop.

Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.  A problem? This is an emergency!

It sounds like a hairball.  I know what a hairball sounds like.

Where's Dr. Monroe?  It's  :   in the morning.

I'm sure he's home sleeping. He'll come in if he has to.

Just wait in here with Hercules and I'll be a few minutes, all right?

Mike Kripke's basement.

What? What does that mean?

You're John Connor.

I'm Kate Brewster.

We went to West Hills Junior High together.

Jesus.  What happened to you, John?

Middle of eighth grade, you just disappeared.

And there was that thing about your foster parents.

Yeah, they were murdered.

I didn't do it.

What the hell?

Is somebody with you?

Katherine Brewster?

No.

John Connor was here. Where did he go?

Tell me. Where did he go?

Katherine Brewster?

What are you doing? Let me down!

Let me down! Let me down!

Where is John Connor?

If I tell you, will you let me go?

Yes.

He's...

...in the kennel, in a cage.

You said that you'd let me go.

I lied.

Please, please, please. You have to let me go!

John Connor.

It is time.

You here to kill me?

No. You must live.

Why are you here?

Where are we going?  Keep moving.

Get out of here.

Now!

No pulse.  See if you can get him down.

I can't.

This guy weighs a ton.

   .  Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

Where are you now?  I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

It's a Toyota Tundra.

It says "Emery Animal Hospital" on the side. I'm locked inside the back.

Hello?

Hello?

Shit! Shit!

Get off.

Let me out!

What are you doing here?

You tell me. You got me into this.

Stop the car.  I can't. Not yet.

You bastard! Stop the car!  Shut up!

Son of a bitch.

Goddamn it.

Look what you did to my car.

This is my company car, asshole.

Get your ass out here.

Get your ass out of the car. Now!

What are you doing?

If you don't have insurance, I'm gonna rip your balls off.

I don't want any problems, okay?  Shut up!

Help!

Who's talking back there? What's going on?

Calm down.  Shut up!

I'm being kidnapped! Call the police!  Well, I'll be goddamned.

Call    !  A cop when you need one.

Help, please! Please!

Let me out of here! Help!

Get back here, asshole!

That's the cops! You have to pull over!

Yeah, first chance I get.

Hold on!

Stop it!

I'll drive.

Get out.

Excuse me.

Move over.

No sign of brain trauma.

Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

Do you even remember me?

Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne?

"Hasta la vista, baby." Ring any bells?

That was a different T   .

What, do you come off an assembly line or something?

Exactly.

Oh, man. I'm gonna have to teach you everything all over again.

Katherine Brewster, have you sustained injury?

Drop dead, you asshole!

I'm unable to comply.

Where are you taking me?

To a safe location.

All right, get off at the next exit. Let her out.

Negative. Katherine Brewster must be protected.

I thought they were after me.  You could not be located.

So a TX was sent back through time to eliminate your lieutenants.

So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

No, no. No, you shouldn't even exist.

I mean, we took out Cyberdyne over    years ago.

We stopped Judgment Day.  You only postponed it.

Judgment Day is inevitable.

I require a cutting tool.

Here, take the wheel.

What are you doing?  I am powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

My primary cell was damaged by a plasma attack.

TX is designed for extreme combat, driven by a plasma reactor...

...and equipped with onboard weapons.

Its arsenal includes...

...nanotechnological transjectors.

Meaning?  It can control other machines.

Its body chassis is heavily armoured and hardened to withstand attack.

You'll find a way to destroy her.  Unlikely.

I'm an obsolete design.

TX is faster, more powerful and more intelligent.

It's a far more effective killing machine.

Oh, great.

That's great.

My presence in this timeline has been anticipated.

TX is designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms.

So she's an antiTerminator Terminator?

You've gotta be shitting me.

No, I am not shitting you.

When ruptured, the fuel cells become unstable.

Relax.

Let me out of here!  Relax!

Man, this is wack.

It's been like this for hours. Every goddamn station.

Hey.

Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

Talk to the hand.

Help! Help me!

Help!

I think we better go.

Jerky?

You're kidnapping me.

Look...  God, you were always a delinquent.

And look at you now, sitting there like the badboy thing still works.

What are you, some kind of gang member?

How do you live with yourself?

What?

Tell her who I am.

John Connor is leader of the Worldwide Resistance...

...and last hope of humankind.

Right. And him?

He's a robot from the future.

Living tissue over a metal skeleton, sent back in time to protect me.

Go to hell.

He doesn't mean you any harm.

I have a fianc√©.

He's gonna be looking for me.

What is it that you want?

Just...

...imagine...

...if you knew you were gonna do something important with your life.

Something amazing.

Maybe the most important thing anyone has ever done.

But there's a catch.

Something terrible has to happen.

You couldn't...

...live with yourself if you didn't try to stop it, but...

What are you talking about?

It's just... The life you know...

...all the stuff that you take for granted...

...it's not gonna last.

Mike Kripke.

Back there, why did you say "Kripke's basement"?

Because Mike Kripke's house...

...that's where the kids used to go make out, right?

So you and me... Wait, did we...?

Holy shit, we did.

We made out in Kripke's basement. I cannot believe you remembered that.

I must have made some kind of impression.

Give me a break.

I only remembered because the next day you were in the news.

Wait a second. You and me hooked up the day before I first met him.

And now again,    years later.

We were supposed to meet.

Coincidence.

Yeah.

Hon? Did you just get in?

Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D. This is Detective Bell.

We're looking for Katherine Brewster. Is she here?

No.

You're her fianc√©, Scott Mason?  Yes.

There was an incident at the veterinary hospital where she works.

We're concerned something may have happened to her.

Where is she?

We got a report from a gas station attendant near Victorville...

...about a possible kidnapping and it might be related.

I'll help you find her.

Come with me.

Go.

Your mother?

I never even knew where she was buried.

I hit the road the day she died.

Why did you bring me here?

No! What are you doing?

Hey, stop!

Get away from it! Stop!

Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico.

Her friends scattered her ashes in the sea.

They stored these weapons in accordance with her will.

What happened to her?

Leukaemia.

I'm sorry.

We were living in Baja when she was diagnosed.

They only gave her six months.

But she fought for three years.

Long enough to make sure.

To make sure?

That the world didn't end.

"Every day after this one is a gift."

She told me, "We made it. We're free."

But I never really believed that.

I guess she didn't either.

You know you were about the closest thing to a father I ever had?

How pathetic is that?

Out of my way!

My mission is to protect you.

That's enough.

Move or I'll do it! I swear I will! I'll shoot you!

Go ahead. See what happens.

Don't do that.

Oh, my God.

This is the police.  We have the building surrounded.

Release your hostage!

Just leave me here. I'm not the one you want. You're wasting your time.

Incorrect. John Connor leads the Resistance to victory.

How?

Why? Why me?

You are John Connor.

Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit since the cradle.

Look at me. I'm no leader, I never was!

I'm never gonna...

Let go.

You're right. You're not the one I want.

I'm wasting my time.

Fuck you, you fucking machine!

Better.

Oh, you were just dicking with me?

Anger is more useful than despair.

What?

Basic psychology is among my subroutines.

Perps still holed up?

Gotcha.

Good news. Your fianc√©e's okay.

Where is she?

Greenlawn Cemetery, up off the   freeway.

It's right by the desert. But they're gonna bring her back to the...

Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.

I'm a posttrauma counsellor for the sheriff's department.

How are you feeling?

He's not human.

He's really not human.

I know what it's like to be in a hostage situation.

I've been there myself.

The fear, the adrenaline.

You find yourself imagining things.

Impossible things.

Crazy things.

Insane things.

Take years to get over it.

Go, go, go!  Move it!

Drop your weapon!

And the coffin!

Take him down! Take him down!

Resume fire!

We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.

Why? What makes her so goddamn important?

Through her, you contact remnants of the military...

...and learn how to fight Skynet, forming the core of the Resistance.

Later, your children will become important.

What?  She's your wife.

Get in!

Do you want to live? Come on!

It was Scott! How could it be Scott?  Your fianc√©?

The TX is polymimetic, able to take the form of anything it touches.

Your fianc√© is dead.

Oh, my God!

Do something!

Get down.

We need a new vehicle.

Hey, come on.

We gotta keep moving.

She killed Scott because of me.

Look, I know this won't help...

...but sometimes things happen that we just can't change.

It's not your fault.

Are you sure about this?

About her and me, I mean.

Your confusion is not rational. She's a healthy female of breeding age.

There's more to it than that.

My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bonding.

So this Terminatrix, how many others does she have on her hit list?

Twentytwo. Anderson, Elizabeth. Anderson, William.

Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

My father?

Having failed to acquire its primary target...

...TX will resume its default program.

She's gonna kill my father too?  There's a high probability.

No.  Who is he? What does he do?

He's in the Air Force. Weapon design, secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

General Robert Brewster is program director of CRS...

...Cyber Research Systems, autonomous weapons division.

Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

Skynet is one of the digital defence systems developed under Brewster.

Oh, God.

Oh, my God. Of course.

It all makes sense now.

If you hadn't come back when I was a kid, changed everything...

...we would have gotten together then. I would have met her father.

Don't you see?  I don't understand.

Your father. This is all about your father.

He's the key. He always was.

Your father is the one who can shut Skynet down.

He's the only one who ever could.

We have to get to him before the TX does.

Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission.

This is your mission, to save people!

My mission is to ensure the survival of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

I am giving you an order.

I am not programmed to follow your orders.

After the nuclear war, you both...  Nuclear war?!

There doesn't have to be a war! We can stop it!

There is insufficient time.

The first launch sequences will be initiated at  :   p.m.

What, today?  Affirmative.

John, what is he saying?

Judgment Day.

The end of the world.

It's today, three hours from now.

Two hours and    minutes.

We must continue south into Mexico to escape the primary blast zones.

No, we have to get to her dad.

The Mojave area will sustain significant nuclear fallout.

You will not survive.

You mean we go hide somewhere in a hole while the bombs fall?

It is your destiny.

Fuck my destiny.  John.

You cannot selfterminate.

No, you can't. I can do whatever I want.

I'm a human being. I'm not some goddamn robot.

Cybernetic organism.  Whatever!

Either we get her father to shut Skynet down...

...stop this shit from ever happening, or so much for the great John Connor.

Because your future, my destiny, I don't want any part of it. I never did.

Based on your pupil dilation, skin temperature and motor functions...

...I calculate an   % probability that you will not pull the trigger.

Please do what he says. You have to save my father!

We can reach CRS in approximately one hour...

...depending on traffic conditions.

I can't get a line.

The whole cell network is down.

Skynet is assuming control over global communications...

...in preparation for its attack.

So if this war is between people and machines...

...why are you on our side?

The Resistance captured me and reprogrammed my CPU.

I was originally designed for assassination missions.

So...

...you don't really care if this mission succeeds or not.

If we get killed, does that mean anything to you?

If you were to die, I will become useless.

There will be no reason for me to exist.

Thank you for doing this.

Your gratitude is not required.

I am programmed to follow your commands.

Her commands?

Katherine Brewster had me reactivated...

...and sent through the time displacement field.

What exactly am I in this future of yours?

You're John Connor's spouse and secondincommand.

No, I...

What?

You're a mess.

Hey, you're not exactly my type, either.

Why didn't I send you back?

I am not authorized to answer your question.

Why didn't he send you back?  He was dead.

Well, that sucks.

Humans inevitably die.  Yeah, I know.

So how does it...? No.

Maybe I don't want to know.

How does he die?

John Connor was terminated on July  th,     .

I was selected for the emotional attachment he had for my model...

...due to his boyhood experiences. This aided in my infiltration.

What are you saying?

I killed you.

This has to be a mistake. As of      all military systems were secure.

They were. Only the civilian sector was affected. Internet, air traffic.

Minutes ago, guidance computers at Vandenberg crashed.

We thought it was an error. It looks like the virus.

Early warning in Alaska is down.  Satellite signals are scrambled.

What about the missile silos, the subs?

We've lost contact.

You're saying this country is completely open to attack.

Theoretically, we could be under attack already.

Who's doing this? A foreign power or some computer hacker in his garage?

We can't trace the virus or pin it down.

It keeps growing and changing, like it has a mind of its own.

This can't be happening.

The Pentagon's on the secure line. It's the chairman.

All right.

Look...

...none of this is gonna happen.

We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

He won't have to kill me someday.

He'll never even exist.

You and I, we can just go our separate ways.

You know, Mike Kripke's basement...

That was the first time I ever kissed a guy.

Really?

Your levity is good.

It relieves tension and the fear of death.

 We're hoping you have  a solution for us.

I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready for a systemwide connection.

 That's not what your civilian  counterparts there told me.

 They say we can stop  this damn virus.

 I understand there's a certain amount  of performance anxiety...

 ... but your boys say if we plug Skynet  into all of our systems...

 ... it'll squash this thing and give me  back control of my military.

Mr. Chairman, I need to make myself very clear.

If we uplink now, Skynet will be in control of your military.

 But you'll be in control  of Skynet, right?

That is correct, sir.

 Then do it.

 And, Brewster, if this thing works...

 ... you'll get all the funding  you'll ever need.

Yes, sir.

Sir?

Shall I?

No.

It's my job now.

  Skynet Defence System activated.  We're in.

We're past the firewalls, local defence nets, Minutemen, subs.

Skynet's fully operational, processing at    teraflops a second.

It should take less than a minute to find the virus and kill it.

Let's pray to God this works.

Power failure?

No. I don't know what it is.

What the hell is going on?

Daddy!

What are you doing here?

Daddy! Get away from it!

Watch out!

Daddy, don't move.

She'll be back.

We have to shut down Skynet.

Where's the system core? In this building?

Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

Skynet is the virus! It's why everything's falling apart!

Skynet has become selfaware.

In one hour it will initiate a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

What enemy?

Us!

Humans.

Oh, God! It's the machines. They're starting to take over.

My office, on this floor, we have to get there.

The access codes are in my safe.

 Why are they killing everyone?  To destroy any threat to Skynet.

Which ones are the codes?

Red envelope.

Crystal Peak. You have to get to Crystal Peak.

 What is he saying?  Crystal Peak.

A hardened facility in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Fiftytwo miles northeast, bearing  .  degrees.

That's the system core?

It's your only chance.

You'll need a plane. The particle accelerator leads to the runway.

Take care of my daughter.

Oh, Katie, I am sorry.

I opened Pandora's box.

Get down!

There's nothing you can do. Come on.

We must go. It is not safe here.

Kate, we have to go.

Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

He wanted us to shut Skynet down. Come on.

Come on.

Run!

Let's go.

That's it. We can follow it out to the runway.

Come on.

What?

Nothing.

You remind me of my mother.

Oh, God. She's coming.

What are you doing?

Powering up.

Come on.

It's working.

Just die, you bitch!

Come on.

There's my father's plane. I trained on it.

Yes! He made it.

Get away from me.

Leave!

Now!

Let's go!

 The master's on. Throttle's set.  Come on. Let's go.

Oh, please. You can't do this.

I have no choice.

The TX...

...has corrupted my system.

You can't kill a human being. You said so yourself.

Let him go!

You're fighting it right now.

My CPU is intact.

But I cannot control my other functions.

You don't have to do this. You don't want to do this!

Desire is irrelevant.

I am a machine.

What is your mission?

To ensure the survival of John Connor...

...and Katherine Brewster.

You are about to fail that mission!

I can... I cannot.

You know what you have to do.

You know my destiny.

I have to live.

 Are you okay?  What happened?

He couldn't do it. He shut himself down.

 Can you fly?  Yeah.

Okay.     degrees...

...   miles, our max air speed is about    .

We've got    minutes.

It's just you and me now.

What if we can't stop it?

There's enough C  here to take out    supercomputers.

We're gonna make it, Kate.

The future is up to us.

That's gotta be it.

Skynet. There may be more of them.

Come on.

I think this is some kind of blast door.

There's no way we can blow through this thing.

John, look.

Now what?

It's a code prompt.

Type in "Dakota    ".

"Red    ".

Come on! We gotta get this thing open.

Here. It's "Avalon    ".

Put it in!

Come on!

I'm back.

Go! Now!

Come on!

 Thank you.  We'll meet again.

Go!

Come on!

You are terminated.

The elevator.

I'll set the detonator for five minutes.

That should give us enough time to get back up.

What is this place?

These computers are    years old.

This isn't Skynet.

There's nothing here.

This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.

Only they never got the warning.

Goddamn it!

There's nothing here!

Why didn't he tell us?

Why did he lead us down here?

To live.

That was his mission.

There was never any stopping it.

John...

...we could just...

...let it go.

 Hello?

 Hello? Can somebody hear me?

This is Montana Civil Defence.

 Somebody please come in.

 Is there anybody there?

 Anyone reading me? Over.

 Rumours about a launch sequence.

 Command and control  have broken down.

 Is anyone receiving me?  Somebody?

 Somebody please come in.

 Anybody out there?

  SAC Nellis. We're under attack.   CQ? CQ?

 Is anybody there?

This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

 Connor? What the hell is happening?  Who's in charge there?

I am.

 Connor, can you help us?

 This is Montana Civil Defence.  Where did you say you were again?

 By the time Skynet  became self-aware...

 ... it had spread into millions of  computer servers across the planet.

 Ordinary computers in office  buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere.

 It was software in cyberspace.

 There was no system core.  It could not be shut down.

 The attack began,  just as he said it would.

 Judgment Day.

 The day the human race  was nearly destroyed...

 ... by weapons they'd built to protect themselves.

 I should have realized our destiny  was never to stop Judgment Day.

 It was merely to survive it...

 ... together.

 The Terminator knew.

 He tried to tell us...

 ... but I didn't want to hear it.

 Maybe the future has been written.  I don't know.

 All I know is what  the Terminator taught me:

 Never stop fighting.

 And I never will.

 The battle has just begun.






The future has not been written.

There is no fate but what  we make for ourselves.

I wish I could believe that.

My name is John Connor.

They tried to murder me  before I was born.

When I was    they tried again.

Machines from the future.

Terminators.

All my life, my mother told me  the storm was coming.

Judgment Day.  Connor!

The beginning of a war  between man and machines.

Three billion lives  would vanish in an instant.

And I would lead what was left  of the human race to ultimate victory.

It hasn't happened.

No bombs fell.

Computers didn't take control.

We stopped Judgment Day.

I should feel safe...

... but I don't.

So I live off the grid.

No phone, no address.

No one and nothing can find me.

I've erased all connections  to the past.

But as hard as I try...

... I can't erase my dreams...

... my nightmares.

I feel the weight of the future  bearing down on me.

A future I don't want.

So I keep running...

... as fast as I can.

Anywhere.

Nowhere.

Oh, my God.

Are you okay?

Do you want me to call    ?

I like this car.

What are you...?

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

Slow down and pull over immediately.

Lady, have you any idea how fast you were going?

Let me see your license and registration.

I like your gun.

What?

This stupid thing's not working.

What's wrong with this thing?

I hate machines.

Hello?   Kate, it's your father.

You're blowing me off again.

I'm so sorry. You know how much I wanted to see you this weekend.

We're having computer problems...  I know, you can't talk about it.

It's just...

...Scott was really looking forward to this.

Katie. I wish I had more time  to get to know him. I really do.

That's okay. You're bound to run into him at the wedding.

Please. I'm still in a state of denial about that.

You're not the only one.   Hey, kiddo.

You don't need me to pass judgment on this guy.

You've done the right thing your whole life.

You won't make a mistake.  You never do.

I'm the luckiest father  in the world, you know?

I've never had to be afraid for my daughter.

Listen, I hate this. I gotta run. Come  see me. I promise I won't cancel.

We will.

Bye, Dad, I love you.  Love you too.

Okay, what have we got?  This new computer virus is tricky.

It's infected half the civilian Internet as well as secondary military apps.

Payroll, inventory.  Primary defence nets are still clean?

So far the firewalls are holding up.

Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use our Al to scan the infrastructure.

Search and destroy for any hint of the virus.

I know, Tony, but that's like going after a fly with a bazooka.

Once the connection's made, it should only be a few minutes.

During which we put everything under the control of one computer system.

The most intelligent system ever conceived.

I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.

I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

Yes, sir.

Thanks.

You're supposed to go around to the back.

Hey, I said you're supposed to go...

Take off your clothes.  Patience, honey.

Bitch. Wait your turn.

Your clothes.  Talk to the hand.

Now.

Welcome to Jim's Burgers.  Can I take your order?

Jose Barrera?   Yeah, that's me.

Growing concern over widespread  outages in the global digital network...

... have prompted rumours  of a new computer supervirus.

Wall Street analysts are confident...  Shit! My mom's home.

Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer. Here. Take that.

Go, go, go.

Elizabeth and William Anderson?

I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs. Is there something wrong?

What's going on?

I have to go to the clinic. It's an emergency.

It's  :   in the morning.

Well, I'll be back before you get up.

Cool it, guys, it's just me.

We've got a sick cat coming in.

Great.

Junkies.

Please, don't do that.

I suppose it was you who ripped us off last week.

Put the phone down.

Sorry.

I just...

I needed some medicine.

There's an emergency clinic half a mile away.

Can't do that.

How much did you take?

Enough.  Well...

...this is the stuff we use to chemically neuter dogs.

Take a look.

Hey!

Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

Next time bring a clue, not a paintball gun.

No, this isn't what you think.  Yeah, right.

I think Hercules has got pneumonia. He started coughing and won't stop.

Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.  A problem? This is an emergency!

It sounds like a hairball.  I know what a hairball sounds like.

Where's Dr. Monroe?  It's  :   in the morning.

I'm sure he's home sleeping. He'll come in if he has to.

Just wait in here with Hercules and I'll be a few minutes, all right?

Mike Kripke's basement.

What? What does that mean?

You're John Connor.

I'm Kate Brewster.

We went to West Hills Junior High together.

Jesus.  What happened to you, John?

Middle of eighth grade, you just disappeared.

And there was that thing about your foster parents.

Yeah, they were murdered.

I didn't do it.

What the hell?

Is somebody with you?

Katherine Brewster?

No.

John Connor was here. Where did he go?

Tell me. Where did he go?

Katherine Brewster?

What are you doing? Let me down!

Let me down! Let me down!

Where is John Connor?

If I tell you, will you let me go?

Yes.

He's...

...in the kennel, in a cage.

You said that you'd let me go.

I lied.

Please, please, please. You have to let me go!

John Connor.

It is time.

You here to kill me?

No. You must live.

Why are you here?

Where are we going?  Keep moving.

Get out of here.

Now!

No pulse.  See if you can get him down.

I can't.

This guy weighs a ton.

   .  Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

Where are you now?  I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

It's a Toyota Tundra.

It says "Emery Animal Hospital" on the side. I'm locked inside the back.

Hello?

Hello?

Shit! Shit!

Get off.

Let me out!

What are you doing here?

You tell me. You got me into this.

Stop the car.  I can't. Not yet.

You bastard! Stop the car!  Shut up!

Son of a bitch.

Goddamn it.

Look what you did to my car.

This is my company car, asshole.

Get your ass out here.

Get your ass out of the car. Now!

What are you doing?

If you don't have insurance, I'm gonna rip your balls off.

I don't want any problems, okay?  Shut up!

Help!

Who's talking back there? What's going on?

Calm down.  Shut up!

I'm being kidnapped! Call the police!  Well, I'll be goddamned.

Call    !  A cop when you need one.

Help, please! Please!

Let me out of here! Help!

Get back here, asshole!

That's the cops! You have to pull over!

Yeah, first chance I get.

Hold on!

Stop it!

I'll drive.

Get out.

Excuse me.

Move over.

No sign of brain trauma.

Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

Do you even remember me?

Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne?

"Hasta la vista, baby." Ring any bells?

That was a different T   .

What, do you come off an assembly line or something?

Exactly.

Oh, man. I'm gonna have to teach you everything all over again.

Katherine Brewster, have you sustained injury?

Drop dead, you asshole!

I'm unable to comply.

Where are you taking me?

To a safe location.

All right, get off at the next exit. Let her out.

Negative. Katherine Brewster must be protected.

I thought they were after me.  You could not be located.

So a TX was sent back through time to eliminate your lieutenants.

So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

No, no. No, you shouldn't even exist.

I mean, we took out Cyberdyne over    years ago.

We stopped Judgment Day.  You only postponed it.

Judgment Day is inevitable.

I require a cutting tool.

Here, take the wheel.

What are you doing?  I am powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

My primary cell was damaged by a plasma attack.

TX is designed for extreme combat, driven by a plasma reactor...

...and equipped with onboard weapons.

Its arsenal includes...

...nanotechnological transjectors.

Meaning?  It can control other machines.

Its body chassis is heavily armoured and hardened to withstand attack.

You'll find a way to destroy her.  Unlikely.

I'm an obsolete design.

TX is faster, more powerful and more intelligent.

It's a far more effective killing machine.

Oh, great.

That's great.

My presence in this timeline has been anticipated.

TX is designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms.

So she's an antiTerminator Terminator?

You've gotta be shitting me.

No, I am not shitting you.

When ruptured, the fuel cells become unstable.

Relax.

Let me out of here!  Relax!

Man, this is wack.

It's been like this for hours. Every goddamn station.

Hey.

Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

Talk to the hand.

Help! Help me!

Help!

I think we better go.

Jerky?

You're kidnapping me.

Look...  God, you were always a delinquent.

And look at you now, sitting there like the badboy thing still works.

What are you, some kind of gang member?

How do you live with yourself?

What?

Tell her who I am.

John Connor is leader of the Worldwide Resistance...

...and last hope of humankind.

Right. And him?

He's a robot from the future.

Living tissue over a metal skeleton, sent back in time to protect me.

Go to hell.

He doesn't mean you any harm.

I have a fianc√©.

He's gonna be looking for me.

What is it that you want?

Just...

...imagine...

...if you knew you were gonna do something important with your life.

Something amazing.

Maybe the most important thing anyone has ever done.

But there's a catch.

Something terrible has to happen.

You couldn't...

...live with yourself if you didn't try to stop it, but...

What are you talking about?

It's just... The life you know...

...all the stuff that you take for granted...

...it's not gonna last.

Mike Kripke.

Back there, why did you say "Kripke's basement"?

Because Mike Kripke's house...

...that's where the kids used to go make out, right?

So you and me... Wait, did we...?

Holy shit, we did.

We made out in Kripke's basement. I cannot believe you remembered that.

I must have made some kind of impression.

Give me a break.

I only remembered because the next day you were in the news.

Wait a second. You and me hooked up the day before I first met him.

And now again,    years later.

We were supposed to meet.

Coincidence.

Yeah.

Hon? Did you just get in?

Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D. This is Detective Bell.

We're looking for Katherine Brewster. Is she here?

No.

You're her fianc√©, Scott Mason?  Yes.

There was an incident at the veterinary hospital where she works.

We're concerned something may have happened to her.

Where is she?

We got a report from a gas station attendant near Victorville...

...about a possible kidnapping and it might be related.

I'll help you find her.

Come with me.

Go.

Your mother?

I never even knew where she was buried.

I hit the road the day she died.

Why did you bring me here?

No! What are you doing?

Hey, stop!

Get away from it! Stop!

Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico.

Her friends scattered her ashes in the sea.

They stored these weapons in accordance with her will.

What happened to her?

Leukaemia.

I'm sorry.

We were living in Baja when she was diagnosed.

They only gave her six months.

But she fought for three years.

Long enough to make sure.

To make sure?

That the world didn't end.

"Every day after this one is a gift."

She told me, "We made it. We're free."

But I never really believed that.

I guess she didn't either.

You know you were about the closest thing to a father I ever had?

How pathetic is that?

Out of my way!

My mission is to protect you.

That's enough.

Move or I'll do it! I swear I will! I'll shoot you!

Go ahead. See what happens.

Don't do that.

Oh, my God.

This is the police.  We have the building surrounded.

Release your hostage!

Just leave me here. I'm not the one you want. You're wasting your time.

Incorrect. John Connor leads the Resistance to victory.

How?

Why? Why me?

You are John Connor.

Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit since the cradle.

Look at me. I'm no leader, I never was!

I'm never gonna...

Let go.

You're right. You're not the one I want.

I'm wasting my time.

Fuck you, you fucking machine!

Better.

Oh, you were just dicking with me?

Anger is more useful than despair.

What?

Basic psychology is among my subroutines.

Perps still holed up?

Gotcha.

Good news. Your fianc√©e's okay.

Where is she?

Greenlawn Cemetery, up off the   freeway.

It's right by the desert. But they're gonna bring her back to the...

Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.

I'm a posttrauma counsellor for the sheriff's department.

How are you feeling?

He's not human.

He's really not human.

I know what it's like to be in a hostage situation.

I've been there myself.

The fear, the adrenaline.

You find yourself imagining things.

Impossible things.

Crazy things.

Insane things.

Take years to get over it.

Go, go, go!  Move it!

Drop your weapon!

And the coffin!

Take him down! Take him down!

Resume fire!

We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.

Why? What makes her so goddamn important?

Through her, you contact remnants of the military...

...and learn how to fight Skynet, forming the core of the Resistance.

Later, your children will become important.

What?  She's your wife.

Get in!

Do you want to live? Come on!

It was Scott! How could it be Scott?  Your fianc√©?

The TX is polymimetic, able to take the form of anything it touches.

Your fianc√© is dead.

Oh, my God!

Do something!

Get down.

We need a new vehicle.

Hey, come on.

We gotta keep moving.

She killed Scott because of me.

Look, I know this won't help...

...but sometimes things happen that we just can't change.

It's not your fault.

Are you sure about this?

About her and me, I mean.

Your confusion is not rational. She's a healthy female of breeding age.

There's more to it than that.

My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bonding.

So this Terminatrix, how many others does she have on her hit list?

Twentytwo. Anderson, Elizabeth. Anderson, William.

Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

My father?

Having failed to acquire its primary target...

...TX will resume its default program.

She's gonna kill my father too?  There's a high probability.

No.  Who is he? What does he do?

He's in the Air Force. Weapon design, secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

General Robert Brewster is program director of CRS...

...Cyber Research Systems, autonomous weapons division.

Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

Skynet is one of the digital defence systems developed under Brewster.

Oh, God.

Oh, my God. Of course.

It all makes sense now.

If you hadn't come back when I was a kid, changed everything...

...we would have gotten together then. I would have met her father.

Don't you see?  I don't understand.

Your father. This is all about your father.

He's the key. He always was.

Your father is the one who can shut Skynet down.

He's the only one who ever could.

We have to get to him before the TX does.

Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission.

This is your mission, to save people!

My mission is to ensure the survival of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

I am giving you an order.

I am not programmed to follow your orders.

After the nuclear war, you both...  Nuclear war?!

There doesn't have to be a war! We can stop it!

There is insufficient time.

The first launch sequences will be initiated at  :   p.m.

What, today?  Affirmative.

John, what is he saying?

Judgment Day.

The end of the world.

It's today, three hours from now.

Two hours and    minutes.

We must continue south into Mexico to escape the primary blast zones.

No, we have to get to her dad.

The Mojave area will sustain significant nuclear fallout.

You will not survive.

You mean we go hide somewhere in a hole while the bombs fall?

It is your destiny.

Fuck my destiny.  John.

You cannot selfterminate.

No, you can't. I can do whatever I want.

I'm a human being. I'm not some goddamn robot.

Cybernetic organism.  Whatever!

Either we get her father to shut Skynet down...

...stop this shit from ever happening, or so much for the great John Connor.

Because your future, my destiny, I don't want any part of it. I never did.

Based on your pupil dilation, skin temperature and motor functions...

...I calculate an   % probability that you will not pull the trigger.

Please do what he says. You have to save my father!

We can reach CRS in approximately one hour...

...depending on traffic conditions.

I can't get a line.

The whole cell network is down.

Skynet is assuming control over global communications...

...in preparation for its attack.

So if this war is between people and machines...

...why are you on our side?

The Resistance captured me and reprogrammed my CPU.

I was originally designed for assassination missions.

So...

...you don't really care if this mission succeeds or not.

If we get killed, does that mean anything to you?

If you were to die, I will become useless.

There will be no reason for me to exist.

Thank you for doing this.

Your gratitude is not required.

I am programmed to follow your commands.

Her commands?

Katherine Brewster had me reactivated...

...and sent through the time displacement field.

What exactly am I in this future of yours?

You're John Connor's spouse and secondincommand.

No, I...

What?

You're a mess.

Hey, you're not exactly my type, either.

Why didn't I send you back?

I am not authorized to answer your question.

Why didn't he send you back?  He was dead.

Well, that sucks.

Humans inevitably die.  Yeah, I know.

So how does it...? No.

Maybe I don't want to know.

How does he die?

John Connor was terminated on July  th,     .

I was selected for the emotional attachment he had for my model...

...due to his boyhood experiences. This aided in my infiltration.

What are you saying?

I killed you.

This has to be a mistake. As of      all military systems were secure.

They were. Only the civilian sector was affected. Internet, air traffic.

Minutes ago, guidance computers at Vandenberg crashed.

We thought it was an error. It looks like the virus.

Early warning in Alaska is down.  Satellite signals are scrambled.

What about the missile silos, the subs?

We've lost contact.

You're saying this country is completely open to attack.

Theoretically, we could be under attack already.

Who's doing this? A foreign power or some computer hacker in his garage?

We can't trace the virus or pin it down.

It keeps growing and changing, like it has a mind of its own.

This can't be happening.

The Pentagon's on the secure line. It's the chairman.

All right.

Look...

...none of this is gonna happen.

We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

He won't have to kill me someday.

He'll never even exist.

You and I, we can just go our separate ways.

You know, Mike Kripke's basement...

That was the first time I ever kissed a guy.

Really?

Your levity is good.

It relieves tension and the fear of death.

 We're hoping you have  a solution for us.

I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready for a systemwide connection.

 That's not what your civilian  counterparts there told me.

 They say we can stop  this damn virus.

 I understand there's a certain amount  of performance anxiety...

 ... but your boys say if we plug Skynet  into all of our systems...

 ... it'll squash this thing and give me  back control of my military.

Mr. Chairman, I need to make myself very clear.

If we uplink now, Skynet will be in control of your military.

 But you'll be in control  of Skynet, right?

That is correct, sir.

 Then do it.

 And, Brewster, if this thing works...

 ... you'll get all the funding  you'll ever need.

Yes, sir.

Sir?

Shall I?

No.

It's my job now.

  Skynet Defence System activated.  We're in.

We're past the firewalls, local defence nets, Minutemen, subs.

Skynet's fully operational, processing at    teraflops a second.

It should take less than a minute to find the virus and kill it.

Let's pray to God this works.

Power failure?

No. I don't know what it is.

What the hell is going on?

Daddy!

What are you doing here?

Daddy! Get away from it!

Watch out!

Daddy, don't move.

She'll be back.

We have to shut down Skynet.

Where's the system core? In this building?

Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

Skynet is the virus! It's why everything's falling apart!

Skynet has become selfaware.

In one hour it will initiate a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

What enemy?

Us!

Humans.

Oh, God! It's the machines. They're starting to take over.

My office, on this floor, we have to get there.

The access codes are in my safe.

 Why are they killing everyone?  To destroy any threat to Skynet.

Which ones are the codes?

Red envelope.

Crystal Peak. You have to get to Crystal Peak.

 What is he saying?  Crystal Peak.

A hardened facility in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Fiftytwo miles northeast, bearing  .  degrees.

That's the system core?

It's your only chance.

You'll need a plane. The particle accelerator leads to the runway.

Take care of my daughter.

Oh, Katie, I am sorry.

I opened Pandora's box.

Get down!

There's nothing you can do. Come on.

We must go. It is not safe here.

Kate, we have to go.

Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

He wanted us to shut Skynet down. Come on.

Come on.

Run!

Let's go.

That's it. We can follow it out to the runway.

Come on.

What?

Nothing.

You remind me of my mother.

Oh, God. She's coming.

What are you doing?

Powering up.

Come on.

It's working.

Just die, you bitch!

Come on.

There's my father's plane. I trained on it.

Yes! He made it.

Get away from me.

Leave!

Now!

Let's go!

 The master's on. Throttle's set.  Come on. Let's go.

Oh, please. You can't do this.

I have no choice.

The TX...

...has corrupted my system.

You can't kill a human being. You said so yourself.

Let him go!

You're fighting it right now.

My CPU is intact.

But I cannot control my other functions.

You don't have to do this. You don't want to do this!

Desire is irrelevant.

I am a machine.

What is your mission?

To ensure the survival of John Connor...

...and Katherine Brewster.

You are about to fail that mission!

I can... I cannot.

You know what you have to do.

You know my destiny.

I have to live.

 Are you okay?  What happened?

He couldn't do it. He shut himself down.

 Can you fly?  Yeah.

Okay.     degrees...

...   miles, our max air speed is about    .

We've got    minutes.

It's just you and me now.

What if we can't stop it?

There's enough C  here to take out    supercomputers.

We're gonna make it, Kate.

The future is up to us.

That's gotta be it.

Skynet. There may be more of them.

Come on.

I think this is some kind of blast door.

There's no way we can blow through this thing.

John, look.

Now what?

It's a code prompt.

Type in "Dakota    ".

"Red    ".

Come on! We gotta get this thing open.

Here. It's "Avalon    ".

Put it in!

Come on!

I'm back.

Go! Now!

Come on!

 Thank you.  We'll meet again.

Go!

Come on!

You are terminated.

The elevator.

I'll set the detonator for five minutes.

That should give us enough time to get back up.

What is this place?

These computers are    years old.

This isn't Skynet.

There's nothing here.

This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.

Only they never got the warning.

Goddamn it!

There's nothing here!

Why didn't he tell us?

Why did he lead us down here?

To live.

That was his mission.

There was never any stopping it.

John...

...we could just...

...let it go.

 Hello?

 Hello? Can somebody hear me?

This is Montana Civil Defence.

 Somebody please come in.

 Is there anybody there?

 Anyone reading me? Over.

 Rumours about a launch sequence.

 Command and control  have broken down.

 Is anyone receiving me?  Somebody?

 Somebody please come in.

 Anybody out there?

  SAC Nellis. We're under attack.   CQ? CQ?

 Is anybody there?

This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

 Connor? What the hell is happening?  Who's in charge there?

I am.

 Connor, can you help us?

 This is Montana Civil Defence.  Where did you say you were again?

 By the time Skynet  became self-aware...

 ... it had spread into millions of  computer servers across the planet.

 Ordinary computers in office  buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere.

 It was software in cyberspace.

 There was no system core.  It could not be shut down.

 The attack began,  just as he said it would.

 Judgment Day.

 The day the human race  was nearly destroyed...

 ... by weapons they'd built to protect themselves.

 I should have realized our destiny  was never to stop Judgment Day.

 It was merely to survive it...

 ... together.

 The Terminator knew.

 He tried to tell us...

 ... but I didn't want to hear it.

 Maybe the future has been written.  I don't know.

 All I know is what  the Terminator taught me:

 Never stop fighting.

 And I never will.

 The battle has just begun.





I'm Reese, sergeant, TechCom DN38416 assigned to protect you. You've been targeted for termination...It's very important that you live....(The Terminator) He's not a man - a machine. A Terminator. A Cyberdyne Systems Model 101...Not a robot. A cyborg. A cybernetic organism...The Terminator's an infiltration unit, part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis - microprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough. But outside, it's living human tissue - flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs...The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new, they look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot...

Cyborgs don't feel pain, I do. Don't do that again. (Sarah: "Just let me go!") Listen, and understand! That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!

You set us up! It‚Äôs all bullshit, all of it! The Cabinet Minister, the whole business. Got us in here to do your dirty work. ‚Ä¶ shut up! Shut up! ‚Ä¶ So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder! What happened here Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust.

The usual. More money, more freedom, more air.

I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any second.

The chairman defended the attack, saying that space-based weapons are our only defense against the southern block's numerical superiority. And more violence last night on Mars where terrorists demanding independence once again halted the extraction of terbinium ore. Kuato and his so called freedom brigade claimed credit for this latest bombing, which attempted to reopen the sealed off Pyramid Mines. Mars military restored order with minimal use of force and all damage to the strategic facility was repaired within hours.

Conan! What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.

Oh, cookies! I can't wait to toss them.  
Someone you trust wants to talk to you. 
Who is it this time, my Mother?!  
I've seen a lot, but nothing would ever make me cut out my tongue.
If you yield only to a conqueror, then prepared to be conquered. 
Why don't they just call him Girl George?  
My name is Julius and I'm your TWIN brother. 
Oh obviously! The moment I sat down I though I was looking into a mirror. 
We're not identical twins.  
Can you hurry up. My horse is getting tired. 
You've seen those movies where they say  Make my day.  or  I'm your worst nightmare. , well listen to this one. Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers!
I'm going to throw up all over you. 
Go ahead... won't show on this shirt.  
What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!
If you drop your gun now, I promise I won't kill you. 
That's for sleeping with my wife! 
They're six year olds... how much trouble can they be?  
Your levity is good, it relieves tension and the fear of death.
Surprise, I'm your new cellmate. And I've come to make your life a living hell. Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter... has come at last. 
They even think I'm your girlfriend. 
Well we can straighten that out.. see this camera up there.. I can strangle you for the home audience.  
Capitalism! 
You're luggage! How do you Soviets deal with stress? Vodka 
Are these all your lunches? You mean you eat other peoples' lunches? STOP IT!!!
Leave anything for us? 
Just bodies. 
If it bleeds, we can kill it.  
Hey buddy you want a Turbo Man doll? 
Forget it, I'm not gonna sit on YOUR lap.  
When I die I will have to go before him. And he will ask me 'What is the riddle of steel?' And if I don't know he will cast me out of Valhalla and laugh at me! That's Crom! Strong on his mountain!  
Killian! Here's your Subzero! Now....plain zero! 
So the prince of darkness wants to conquer earth. He has to do it one hour before midnight. Is this eastern time?  
I know now why you cry, but it's something I can never do. To be, or not to be. 
Not to be.  
We'll take Cooke's car. He won't be needing it. 
No more complaining. No more 'Mr. Kimble, I have to go the bathroom'. Nothing! There is no bathroom!  
This isn't a plane, this is a canoe with wings! Then get in and start paddling. 
Benny!! Screw you!! 
The CIA got you pushing too many pencils? So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder.  
What happened? 
They caught a train.  
So who are you man? 
I'm the party pooper. 
When I said you should screw yourself. I didn't mean it literally.  
I suppose nothing hurts you. Only pain.  
It's as satisfying to me as, uh, coming is, you know? As, ah, having sex with a woman and coming. And so can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like, uh, getting the feeling of coming in a gym, I'm getting the feeling of coming at home, I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up, when I pose in front of 5,000 people, I get the same feeling, so I am coming day and night. I mean, it's terrific. Right? So you know, I am in heaven.  
If revenge is a dish best cold... then put on your Sunday's finest, it's time to feast!  
We had a difference of opinion. I thought my wife and daughter should live. He felt otherwise.  
Come with me if you want to live. 
What's the difference between you and I? 
The difference is, I'm just gonna kill you. 
What the hell are you?  
You're not sending me to the Cooler! 
You gotta be shitting me! 
No. I am not shitting you. 
You gotta be shitting me! 
I am not shitting you.  
Stop whining! You kids are soft. You lack discipline. 
You think you're funny, don't you? 
I know I am. I'm the famous comedian, Arnold Braunschweiger. 
Schwarzenegger! 
Gesundheit. 
Hey Claudius! You killed my father. Big mistake. 
Snakes?! Did you say snakes?!  
Don't break radio silence until they see me. 
How will I know? 
Because all fucking hell is going to break loose. 
The bridge is out!!!  
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 
Uplinks on the ground. Uplinks underground. You guys don't shut up, I'm going to uplink your ass... you'll be on the ground!  
Bucks? Doe? What is all this zoological talk about male and female animals? 
Fuck YOU, asshole!  
First I will turn Gotham into an icy graveyard. Then I will pull Batman's heart from his body and feel it freeze in my hand. 
Come on Cohagen. You got what you want. Give these people air!!  
What happened to Buzzsaw? 
Ahhh.. he had to split.  
Don't disturb my friend... he's dead tired. 
Crom. I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we fought and why we died. No, all that matter's is that two stood against many. That's what is important. Battle pleases you Crom. Grant me one request, grant me revenge. And if you do not listen, then to hell with you!  
Between your faith and my Glock nine millimeter, I'll take the Glock.  
A freeze is coming!  
Let off some steam, Bennett! 
You'd let me die here? No. That's the last thing that will happen to you. First, the air's gonna heat up in here to 451 degrees. than your pass will explode like a Roman candle, your socks will ignite, and your fingernails will melt.  
You should clone yourself while you‚Äôre still alive. 
So I can understand your unique perspective? 
No. So you can go fuck yourself!  
I love you too, sweetheart.
You scared mutha fucka! This green beret is going to kick your ass! 
I eat green berets for breakfast...and I am very hungry!  
Chill-out dickwad.  
Honey, you shouldn't drink and bake. 
Iced that guy!  
Where's Sully? 
I let him go.  
Nice night for a walk.  
I'm pregnant. 
What have you been feeding this thing? 
Blondes! 
Stick around! 
What the hell did you do to him?! 
I did nothing. The pavement was his enemy. 
You bastard! Drop dead! 
I don't do requests. 
It's called the Miranda act.. it says you can't even touch his ass. 
I do not want to touch his ass.. I want to make him talk!  
You want to be a farmer? Here's a couple of acres!  
First I'm gonna use you as a human shield, then I gonna take that chisel and kill the guard with it. Then I was thinking about breaking your neck.  
Milk are for babies, when you get older you drink beer.  
I promise not to kill anyone. 
He'll live. 
Get to the chopper!!  
Conan, what is best in life? 
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women! 
Consider this a divorce!  
I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.  
No, it's not a tumor. It's not a tumor! 
Oh, you think you're bad, huh? You're a fucking choir boy compared to me! A choir boy!!  
Get your ass to Mars
Fuck you, asshole.
Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last?
That's right, Matrix! You did!
I LIED!
Hasta la vista, baby.
You are one ugly motherfucker.
See you at the party, Richter!
I live to see you eat that contract! But I hope you leave enough room for my fist, because I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine!
Are you Sarah Conner?
Have you ever killed anyone?
Yes, but they were all bad!
I'll be back.
Nice night for a walk.
Nothing clean.  Right.
Your clothes.  Give them to me. Now. 
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
Wrong.
This is One-Four-Three.  West-bound on Olympic, approaching Overland.
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she is here.  Can I see her, please?
Where is she?
I'll come back. 
Fuck you, asshole.
Hello.
Tell me your address there.
I'm Reese, sergeant, TechCom DN38416 assigned to protect you. You've been targeted for termination...It's very important that you live....(The Terminator) He's not a man - a machine. A Terminator. A Cyberdyne Systems Model 101...Not a robot. A cyborg. A cybernetic organism...The Terminator's an infiltration unit, part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis - microprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough. But outside, it's living human tissue - flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs...The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new, they look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot...

Cyborgs don't feel pain, I do. Don't do that again. (Sarah: "Just let me go!") Listen, and understand! That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!

You set us up! It‚Äôs all bullshit, all of it! The Cabinet Minister, the whole business. Got us in here to do your dirty work. ‚Ä¶ shut up! Shut up! ‚Ä¶ So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder! What happened here Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust.

The usual. More money, more freedom, more air.

I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any second.

The chairman defended the attack, saying that space-based weapons are our only defense against the southern block's numerical superiority. And more violence last night on Mars where terrorists demanding independence once again halted the extraction of terbinium ore. Kuato and his so called freedom brigade claimed credit for this latest bombing, which attempted to reopen the sealed off Pyramid Mines. Mars military restored order with minimal use of force and all damage to the strategic facility was repaired within hours.

Conan! What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.

Oh, cookies! I can't wait to toss them.  
Someone you trust wants to talk to you. 
Who is it this time, my Mother?!  
I've seen a lot, but nothing would ever make me cut out my tongue.
If you yield only to a conqueror, then prepared to be conquered. 
Why don't they just call him Girl George?  
My name is Julius and I'm your TWIN brother. 
Oh obviously! The moment I sat down I though I was looking into a mirror. 
We're not identical twins.  
Can you hurry up. My horse is getting tired. 
You've seen those movies where they say  Make my day.  or  I'm your worst nightmare. , well listen to this one. Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers!
I'm going to throw up all over you. 
Go ahead... won't show on this shirt.  
What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!
If you drop your gun now, I promise I won't kill you. 
That's for sleeping with my wife! 
They're six year olds... how much trouble can they be?  
Your levity is good, it relieves tension and the fear of death.
Surprise, I'm your new cellmate. And I've come to make your life a living hell. Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter... has come at last. 
They even think I'm your girlfriend. 
Well we can straighten that out.. see this camera up there.. I can strangle you for the home audience.  
Capitalism! 
You're luggage! How do you Soviets deal with stress? Vodka 
Are these all your lunches? You mean you eat other peoples' lunches? STOP IT!!!
Leave anything for us? 
Just bodies. 
If it bleeds, we can kill it.  
Hey buddy you want a Turbo Man doll? 
Forget it, I'm not gonna sit on YOUR lap.  
When I die I will have to go before him. And he will ask me 'What is the riddle of steel?' And if I don't know he will cast me out of Valhalla and laugh at me! That's Crom! Strong on his mountain!  
Killian! Here's your Subzero! Now....plain zero! 
So the prince of darkness wants to conquer earth. He has to do it one hour before midnight. Is this eastern time?  
I know now why you cry, but it's something I can never do. To be, or not to be. 
Not to be.  
We'll take Cooke's car. He won't be needing it. 
No more complaining. No more 'Mr. Kimble, I have to go the bathroom'. Nothing! There is no bathroom!  
This isn't a plane, this is a canoe with wings! Then get in and start paddling. 
Benny!! Screw you!! 
The CIA got you pushing too many pencils? So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder.  
What happened? 
They caught a train.  
So who are you man? 
I'm the party pooper. 
When I said you should screw yourself. I didn't mean it literally.  
I suppose nothing hurts you. Only pain.  
It's as satisfying to me as, uh, coming is, you know? As, ah, having sex with a woman and coming. And so can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like, uh, getting the feeling of coming in a gym, I'm getting the feeling of coming at home, I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up, when I pose in front of 5,000 people, I get the same feeling, so I am coming day and night. I mean, it's terrific. Right? So you know, I am in heaven.  
If revenge is a dish best cold... then put on your Sunday's finest, it's time to feast!  
We had a difference of opinion. I thought my wife and daughter should live. He felt otherwise.  
Come with me if you want to live. 
What's the difference between you and I? 
The difference is, I'm just gonna kill you. 
What the hell are you?  
You're not sending me to the Cooler! 
You gotta be shitting me! 
No. I am not shitting you. 
You gotta be shitting me! 
I am not shitting you.  
Stop whining! You kids are soft. You lack discipline. 
You think you're funny, don't you? 
I know I am. I'm the famous comedian, Arnold Braunschweiger. 
Schwarzenegger! 
Gesundheit. 
Hey Claudius! You killed my father. Big mistake. 
Snakes?! Did you say snakes?!  
Don't break radio silence until they see me. 
How will I know? 
Because all fucking hell is going to break loose. 
The bridge is out!!!  
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 
Uplinks on the ground. Uplinks underground. You guys don't shut up, I'm going to uplink your ass... you'll be on the ground!  
Bucks? Doe? What is all this zoological talk about male and female animals? 
Fuck YOU, asshole!  
First I will turn Gotham into an icy graveyard. Then I will pull Batman's heart from his body and feel it freeze in my hand. 
Come on Cohagen. You got what you want. Give these people air!!  
What happened to Buzzsaw? 
Ahhh.. he had to split.  
Don't disturb my friend... he's dead tired. 
Crom. I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we fought and why we died. No, all that matter's is that two stood against many. That's what is important. Battle pleases you Crom. Grant me one request, grant me revenge. And if you do not listen, then to hell with you!  
Between your faith and my Glock nine millimeter, I'll take the Glock.  
A freeze is coming!  
Let off some steam, Bennett! 
You'd let me die here? No. That's the last thing that will happen to you. First, the air's gonna heat up in here to 451 degrees. than your pass will explode like a Roman candle, your socks will ignite, and your fingernails will melt.  
You should clone yourself while you‚Äôre still alive. 
So I can understand your unique perspective? 
No. So you can go fuck yourself!  
I love you too, sweetheart.
You scared mutha fucka! This green beret is going to kick your ass! 
I eat green berets for breakfast...and I am very hungry!  
Chill-out dickwad.  
Honey, you shouldn't drink and bake. 
Iced that guy!  
Where's Sully? 
I let him go.  
Nice night for a walk.  
I'm pregnant. 
What have you been feeding this thing? 
Blondes! 
Stick around! 
What the hell did you do to him?! 
I did nothing. The pavement was his enemy. 
You bastard! Drop dead! 
I don't do requests. 
It's called the Miranda act.. it says you can't even touch his ass. 
I do not want to touch his ass.. I want to make him talk!  
You want to be a farmer? Here's a couple of acres!  
First I'm gonna use you as a human shield, then I gonna take that chisel and kill the guard with it. Then I was thinking about breaking your neck.  
Milk are for babies, when you get older you drink beer.  
I promise not to kill anyone. 
He'll live. 
Get to the chopper!!  
Conan, what is best in life? 
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women! 
Consider this a divorce!  
I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.  
No, it's not a tumor. It's not a tumor! 
Oh, you think you're bad, huh? You're a fucking choir boy compared to me! A choir boy!!  
Get your ass to Mars
Fuck you, asshole.
Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last?
That's right, Matrix! You did!
I LIED!
Hasta la vista, baby.
You are one ugly motherfucker.
See you at the party, Richter!
I live to see you eat that contract! But I hope you leave enough room for my fist, because I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine!
Are you Sarah Conner?
Have you ever killed anyone?
Yes, but they were all bad!
I'll be back.
Nice night for a walk.

What the hell did you do to him?! 
I did nothing. The pavement was his enemy. 
You bastard! Drop dead! 
I don't do requests. 
It's called the Miranda act.. it says you can't even touch his ass. 
I do not want to touch his ass.. I want to make him talk!  
You want to be a farmer? Here's a couple of acres!  
First I'm gonna use you as a human shield, then I gonna take that chisel and kill the guard with it. Then I was thinking about breaking your neck.  
Milk are for babies, when you get older you drink beer.  
I promise not to kill anyone. 
He'll live. 
Get to the chopper!!  
Conan, what is best in life? 
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women! 
Consider this a divorce!  
I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.  
No, it's not a tumor. It's not a tumor! 
Oh, you think you're bad, huh? You're a fucking choir boy compared to me! A choir boy!!  
Get your ass to Mars
Fuck you, asshole.
Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last?
That's right, Matrix! You did!
I LIED!
Hasta la vista, baby.
You are one ugly motherfucker.
See you at the party, Richter!
I live to see you eat that contract! But I hope you leave enough room for my fist, because I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine!
Are you Sarah Conner?
Have you ever killed anyone?
Yes, but they were all bad!
I'll be back.
Nice night for a walk.
Nothing clean.  Right.
Your clothes.  Give them to me. Now. 
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
Wrong.
This is One-Four-Three.  West-bound on Olympic, approaching Overland.
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she is here.  Can I see her, please?
Where is she?
I'll come back. 
Fuck you, asshole.
Hello.
Tell me your address there.
I'm Reese, sergeant, TechCom DN38416 assigned to protect you. You've been targeted for termination...It's very important that you live....(The Terminator) He's not a man - a machine. A Terminator. A Cyberdyne Systems Model 101...Not a robot. A cyborg. A cybernetic organism...The Terminator's an infiltration unit, part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis - microprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough. But outside, it's living human tissue - flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs...The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new, they look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot...

Cyborgs don't feel pain, I do. Don't do that again. (Sarah: "Just let me go!") Listen, and understand! That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!

You set us up! It‚Äôs all bullshit, all of it! The Cabinet Minister, the whole business. Got us in here to do your dirty work. ‚Ä¶ shut up! Shut up! ‚Ä¶ So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder! What happened here Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust.

The usual. More money, more freedom, more air.

I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any second.

The chairman defended the attack, saying that space-based weapons are our only defense against the southern block's numerical superiority. And more violence last night on Mars where terrorists demanding independence once again halted the extraction of terbinium ore. Kuato and his so called freedom brigade claimed credit for this latest bombing, which attempted to reopen the sealed off Pyramid Mines. Mars military restored order with minimal use of force and all damage to the strategic facility was repaired within hours.

Conan! What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.

Oh, cookies! I can't wait to toss them.  
Someone you trust wants to talk to you. 
Who is it this time, my Mother?!  
I've seen a lot, but nothing would ever make me cut out my tongue.
If you yield only to a conqueror, then prepared to be conquered. 
Why don't they just call him Girl George?  
My name is Julius and I'm your TWIN brother. 
Oh obviously! The moment I sat down I though I was looking into a mirror. 
We're not identical twins.  
Can you hurry up. My horse is getting tired. 
You've seen those movies where they say  Make my day.  or  I'm your worst nightmare. , well listen to this one. Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers!
I'm going to throw up all over you. 
Go ahead... won't show on this shirt.  
What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!
If you drop your gun now, I promise I won't kill you. 
That's for sleeping with my wife! 
They're six year olds... how much trouble can they be?  
Your levity is good, it relieves tension and the fear of death.
Surprise, I'm your new cellmate. And I've come to make your life a living hell. Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter... has come at last. 
They even think I'm your girlfriend. 
Well we can straighten that out.. see this camera up there.. I can strangle you for the home audience.  
Capitalism! 
You're luggage! How do you Soviets deal with stress? Vodka 
Are these all your lunches? You mean you eat other peoples' lunches? STOP IT!!!
Leave anything for us? 
Just bodies. 
If it bleeds, we can kill it.  
Hey buddy you want a Turbo Man doll? 
Forget it, I'm not gonna sit on YOUR lap.  
When I die I will have to go before him. And he will ask me 'What is the riddle of steel?' And if I don't know he will cast me out of Valhalla and laugh at me! That's Crom! Strong on his mountain!  
Killian! Here's your Subzero! Now....plain zero! 
So the prince of darkness wants to conquer earth. He has to do it one hour before midnight. Is this eastern time?  
I know now why you cry, but it's something I can never do. To be, or not to be. 
Not to be.  
We'll take Cooke's car. He won't be needing it. 
No more complaining. No more 'Mr. Kimble, I have to go the bathroom'. Nothing! There is no bathroom!  
This isn't a plane, this is a canoe with wings! Then get in and start paddling. 
Benny!! Screw you!! 
The CIA got you pushing too many pencils? So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder.  
What happened? 
They caught a train.  
So who are you man? 
I'm the party pooper. 
When I said you should screw yourself. I didn't mean it literally.  
I suppose nothing hurts you. Only pain.  
It's as satisfying to me as, uh, coming is, you know? As, ah, having sex with a woman and coming. And so can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like, uh, getting the feeling of coming in a gym, I'm getting the feeling of coming at home, I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up, when I pose in front of 5,000 people, I get the same feeling, so I am coming day and night. I mean, it's terrific. Right? So you know, I am in heaven.  
If revenge is a dish best cold... then put on your Sunday's finest, it's time to feast!  
We had a difference of opinion. I thought my wife and daughter should live. He felt otherwise.  
Come with me if you want to live. 
What's the difference between you and I? 
The difference is, I'm just gonna kill you. 
What the hell are you?  
You're not sending me to the Cooler! 
You gotta be shitting me! 
No. I am not shitting you. 
You gotta be shitting me! 
I am not shitting you.  
Stop whining! You kids are soft. You lack discipline. 
You think you're funny, don't you? 
I know I am. I'm the famous comedian, Arnold Braunschweiger. 
Schwarzenegger! 
Gesundheit. 
Hey Claudius! You killed my father. Big mistake. 
Snakes?! Did you say snakes?!  
Don't break radio silence until they see me. 
How will I know? 
Because all fucking hell is going to break loose. 
The bridge is out!!!  
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 
Uplinks on the ground. Uplinks underground. You guys don't shut up, I'm going to uplink your ass... you'll be on the ground!  
Bucks? Doe? What is all this zoological talk about male and female animals? 
Fuck YOU, asshole!  
First I will turn Gotham into an icy graveyard. Then I will pull Batman's heart from his body and feel it freeze in my hand. 
Come on Cohagen. You got what you want. Give these people air!!  
What happened to Buzzsaw? 
Ahhh.. he had to split.  
Don't disturb my friend... he's dead tired. 
Crom. I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we fought and why we died. No, all that matter's is that two stood against many. That's what is important. Battle pleases you Crom. Grant me one request, grant me revenge. And if you do not listen, then to hell with you!  
Between your faith and my Glock nine millimeter, I'll take the Glock.  
A freeze is coming!  
Let off some steam, Bennett! 
You'd let me die here? No. That's the last thing that will happen to you. First, the air's gonna heat up in here to 451 degrees. than your pass will explode like a Roman candle, your socks will ignite, and your fingernails will melt.  
You should clone yourself while you‚Äôre still alive. 
So I can understand your unique perspective? 
No. So you can go fuck yourself!  
I love you too, sweetheart.
You scared mutha fucka! This green beret is going to kick your ass! 
I eat green berets for breakfast...and I am very hungry!  
Chill-out dickwad.  
Honey, you shouldn't drink and bake. 
Iced that guy!  
Where's Sully? 
I let him go.  
Nice night for a walk.  
I'm pregnant. 
What have you been feeding this thing? 
Blondes! 
Stick around! 
What the hell did you do to him?! 
I did nothing. The pavement was his enemy. 
You bastard! Drop dead!

First I will turn Gotham into an icy graveyard. Then I will pull Batman's heart from his body and feel it freeze in my hand. 
Come on Cohagen. You got what you want. Give these people air!!  
What happened to Buzzsaw? 
Ahhh.. he had to split.  
Don't disturb my friend... he's dead tired. 
Crom. I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we fought and why we died. No, all that matter's is that two stood against many. That's what is important. Battle pleases you Crom. Grant me one request, grant me revenge. And if you do not listen, then to hell with you!  
Between your faith and my Glock nine millimeter, I'll take the Glock.  
A freeze is coming!  
Let off some steam, Bennett! 
You'd let me die here? No. That's the last thing that will happen to you. First, the air's gonna heat up in here to 451 degrees. than your pass will explode like a Roman candle, your socks will ignite, and your fingernails will melt.  
You should clone yourself while you‚Äôre still alive. 
So I can understand your unique perspective? 
No. So you can go fuck yourself!  
I love you too, sweetheart.
You scared mutha fucka! This green beret is going to kick your ass! 
I eat green berets for breakfast...and I am very hungry!  
Chill-out dickwad.  
Honey, you shouldn't drink and bake. 
Iced that guy!  
Where's Sully? 
I let him go.  
Nice night for a walk.  
I'm pregnant. 
What have you been feeding this thing? 
Blondes! 
Stick around! 
What the hell did you do to him?! 
I did nothing. The pavement was his enemy. 
You bastard! Drop dead! 
I don't do requests. 
It's called the Miranda act.. it says you can't even touch his ass. 
I do not want to touch his ass.. I want to make him talk!  
You want to be a farmer? Here's a couple of acres!  
First I'm gonna use you as a human shield, then I gonna take that chisel and kill the guard with it. Then I was thinking about breaking your neck.  
Milk are for babies, when you get older you drink beer.  
I promise not to kill anyone. 
He'll live. 
Get to the chopper!!  
Conan, what is best in life? 
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women! 
Consider this a divorce!  
I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.  
No, it's not a tumor. It's not a tumor! 
Oh, you think you're bad, huh? You're a fucking choir boy compared to me! A choir boy!!  
Get your ass to Mars
Fuck you, asshole.
Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last?
That's right, Matrix! You did!
I LIED!
Hasta la vista, baby.
You are one ugly motherfucker.
See you at the party, Richter!
I live to see you eat that contract! But I hope you leave enough room for my fist, because I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine!
Are you Sarah Conner?
Have you ever killed anyone?
Yes, but they were all bad!
I'll be back.
Nice night for a walk.
Nothing clean.  Right.
Your clothes.  Give them to me. Now. 
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
Wrong.
This is One-Four-Three.  West-bound on Olympic, approaching Overland.
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she is here.  Can I see her, please?
Where is she?
I'll come back. 
Fuck you, asshole.
Hello.
Tell me your address there.
I'm Reese, sergeant, TechCom DN38416 assigned to protect you. You've been targeted for termination...It's very important that you live....(The Terminator) He's not a man - a machine. A Terminator. A Cyberdyne Systems Model 101...Not a robot. A cyborg. A cybernetic organism...The Terminator's an infiltration unit, part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis - microprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough. But outside, it's living human tissue - flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs...The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new, they look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot...

Cyborgs don't feel pain, I do. Don't do that again. (Sarah: "Just let me go!") Listen, and understand! That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!

You set us up! It‚Äôs all bullshit, all of it! The Cabinet Minister, the whole business. Got us in here to do your dirty work. ‚Ä¶ shut up! Shut up! ‚Ä¶ So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder! What happened here Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust.

The usual. More money, more freedom, more air.

I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any second.

The chairman defended the attack, saying that space-based weapons are our only defense against the southern block's numerical superiority. And more violence last night on Mars where terrorists demanding independence once again halted the extraction of terbinium ore. Kuato and his so called freedom brigade claimed credit for this latest bombing, which attempted to reopen the sealed off Pyramid Mines. Mars military restored order with minimal use of force and all damage to the strategic facility was repaired within hours.

Conan! What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.

Oh, cookies! I can't wait to toss them.  
Someone you trust wants to talk to you. 
Who is it this time, my Mother?!  
I've seen a lot, but nothing would ever make me cut out my tongue.
If you yield only to a conqueror, then prepared to be conquered. 
Why don't they just call him Girl George?  
My name is Julius and I'm your TWIN brother. 
Oh obviously! The moment I sat down I though I was looking into a mirror. 
We're not identical twins.  
Can you hurry up. My horse is getting tired. 
You've seen those movies where they say  Make my day.  or  I'm your worst nightmare. , well listen to this one. Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers!
I'm going to throw up all over you. 
Go ahead... won't show on this shirt.  
What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!
If you drop your gun now, I promise I won't kill you. 
That's for sleeping with my wife! 
They're six year olds... how much trouble can they be?  
Your levity is good, it relieves tension and the fear of death.
Surprise, I'm your new cellmate. And I've come to make your life a living hell. Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter... has come at last. 
They even think I'm your girlfriend. 
Well we can straighten that out.. see this camera up there.. I can strangle you for the home audience.  
Capitalism! 
You're luggage! How do you Soviets deal with stress? Vodka 
Are these all your lunches? You mean you eat other peoples' lunches? STOP IT!!!
Leave anything for us? 
Just bodies. 
If it bleeds, we can kill it.  
Hey buddy you want a Turbo Man doll? 
Forget it, I'm not gonna sit on YOUR lap.  
When I die I will have to go before him. And he will ask me 'What is the riddle of steel?' And if I don't know he will cast me out of Valhalla and laugh at me! That's Crom! Strong on his mountain!  
Killian! Here's your Subzero! Now....plain zero! 
So the prince of darkness wants to conquer earth. He has to do it one hour before midnight. Is this eastern time?  
I know now why you cry, but it's something I can never do. To be, or not to be. 
Not to be.  
We'll take Cooke's car. He won't be needing it. 
No more complaining. No more 'Mr. Kimble, I have to go the bathroom'. Nothing! There is no bathroom!  
This isn't a plane, this is a canoe with wings! Then get in and start paddling. 
Benny!! Screw you!! 
The CIA got you pushing too many pencils? So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder.  
What happened? 
They caught a train.  
So who are you man? 
I'm the party pooper. 
When I said you should screw yourself. I didn't mean it literally.  
I suppose nothing hurts you. Only pain.  
It's as satisfying to me as, uh, coming is, you know? As, ah, having sex with a woman and coming. And so can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like, uh, getting the feeling of coming in a gym, I'm getting the feeling of coming at home, I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up, when I pose in front of 5,000 people, I get the same feeling, so I am coming day and night. I mean, it's terrific. Right? So you know, I am in heaven.  
If revenge is a dish best cold... then put on your Sunday's finest, it's time to feast!  
We had a difference of opinion. I thought my wife and daughter should live. He felt otherwise.  
Come with me if you want to live. 
What's the difference between you and I? 
The difference is, I'm just gonna kill you. 
What the hell are you?  
You're not sending me to the Cooler! 
You gotta be shitting me! 
No. I am not shitting you. 
You gotta be shitting me! 
I am not shitting you.  
Stop whining! You kids are soft. You lack discipline. 
You think you're funny, don't you? 
I know I am. I'm the famous comedian, Arnold Braunschweiger. 
Schwarzenegger! 
Gesundheit. 
Hey Claudius! You killed my father. Big mistake. 
Snakes?! Did you say snakes?!  
Don't break radio silence until they see me. 
How will I know? 
Because all fucking hell is going to break loose. 
The bridge is out!!!  
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 
Uplinks on the ground. Uplinks underground. You guys don't shut up, I'm going to uplink your ass... you'll be on the ground!  
Bucks? Doe? What is all this zoological talk about male and female animals? 
Fuck YOU, asshole!

I am like, uh, getting the feeling of coming in a gym, I'm getting the feeling of coming at home, I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up, when I pose in front of 5,000 people, I get the same feeling, so I am coming day and night. I mean, it's terrific. Right? So you know, I am in heaven.  
If revenge is a dish best cold... then put on your Sunday's finest, it's time to feast!  
We had a difference of opinion. I thought my wife and daughter should live. He felt otherwise.  
Come with me if you want to live. 
What's the difference between you and I? 
The difference is, I'm just gonna kill you. 
What the hell are you?  
You're not sending me to the Cooler! 
You gotta be shitting me! 
No. I am not shitting you. 
You gotta be shitting me! 
I am not shitting you.  
Stop whining! You kids are soft. You lack discipline. 
You think you're funny, don't you? 
I know I am. I'm the famous comedian, Arnold Braunschweiger. 
Schwarzenegger! 
Gesundheit. 
Hey Claudius! You killed my father. Big mistake. 
Snakes?! Did you say snakes?!  
Don't break radio silence until they see me. 
How will I know? 
Because all fucking hell is going to break loose. 
The bridge is out!!!  
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 
Uplinks on the ground. Uplinks underground. You guys don't shut up, I'm going to uplink your ass... you'll be on the ground!  
Bucks? Doe? What is all this zoological talk about male and female animals? 
Fuck YOU, asshole!  
First I will turn Gotham into an icy graveyard. Then I will pull Batman's heart from his body and feel it freeze in my hand. 
Come on Cohagen. You got what you want. Give these people air!!  
What happened to Buzzsaw? 
Ahhh.. he had to split.  
Don't disturb my friend... he's dead tired. 
Crom. I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we fought and why we died. No, all that matter's is that two stood against many. That's what is important. Battle pleases you Crom. Grant me one request, grant me revenge. And if you do not listen, then to hell with you!  
Between your faith and my Glock nine millimeter, I'll take the Glock.  
A freeze is coming!  
Let off some steam, Bennett! 
You'd let me die here? No. That's the last thing that will happen to you. First, the air's gonna heat up in here to 451 degrees. than your pass will explode like a Roman candle, your socks will ignite, and your fingernails will melt.  
You should clone yourself while you‚Äôre still alive. 
So I can understand your unique perspective? 
No. So you can go fuck yourself!  
I love you too, sweetheart.
You scared mutha fucka! This green beret is going to kick your ass! 
I eat green berets for breakfast...and I am very hungry!  
Chill-out dickwad.  
Honey, you shouldn't drink and bake. 
Iced that guy!  
Where's Sully? 
I let him go.  
Nice night for a walk.  
I'm pregnant. 
What have you been feeding this thing? 
Blondes! 
Stick around! 
What the hell did you do to him?! 
I did nothing. The pavement was his enemy. 
You bastard! Drop dead! 
I don't do requests. 
It's called the Miranda act.. it says you can't even touch his ass. 
I do not want to touch his ass.. I want to make him talk!  
You want to be a farmer? Here's a couple of acres!  
First I'm gonna use you as a human shield, then I gonna take that chisel and kill the guard with it. Then I was thinking about breaking your neck.  
Milk are for babies, when you get older you drink beer.  
I promise not to kill anyone. 
He'll live. 
Get to the chopper!!  
Conan, what is best in life? 
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women! 
Consider this a divorce!  
I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.  
No, it's not a tumor. It's not a tumor! 
Oh, you think you're bad, huh? You're a fucking choir boy compared to me! A choir boy!!  
Get your ass to Mars
Fuck you, asshole.
Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last?
That's right, Matrix! You did!
I LIED!
Hasta la vista, baby.
You are one ugly motherfucker.
See you at the party, Richter!
I live to see you eat that contract! But I hope you leave enough room for my fist, because I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine!
Are you Sarah Conner?
Have you ever killed anyone?
Yes, but they were all bad!
I'll be back.
Nice night for a walk.
Nothing clean.  Right.
Your clothes.  Give them to me. Now. 
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
Wrong.
This is One-Four-Three.  West-bound on Olympic, approaching Overland.
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she is here.  Can I see her, please?
Where is she?
I'll come back. 
Fuck you, asshole.
Hello.
Tell me your address there.
I'm Reese, sergeant, TechCom DN38416 assigned to protect you. You've been targeted for termination...It's very important that you live....(The Terminator) He's not a man - a machine. A Terminator. A Cyberdyne Systems Model 101...Not a robot. A cyborg. A cybernetic organism...The Terminator's an infiltration unit, part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis - microprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough. But outside, it's living human tissue - flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs...The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new, they look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot...

Cyborgs don't feel pain, I do. Don't do that again. (Sarah: "Just let me go!") Listen, and understand! That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!

You set us up! It‚Äôs all bullshit, all of it! The Cabinet Minister, the whole business. Got us in here to do your dirty work. ‚Ä¶ shut up! Shut up! ‚Ä¶ So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder! What happened here Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust.

The usual. More money, more freedom, more air.

I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any second.

The chairman defended the attack, saying that space-based weapons are our only defense against the southern block's numerical superiority. And more violence last night on Mars where terrorists demanding independence once again halted the extraction of terbinium ore. Kuato and his so called freedom brigade claimed credit for this latest bombing, which attempted to reopen the sealed off Pyramid Mines. Mars military restored order with minimal use of force and all damage to the strategic facility was repaired within hours.

Conan! What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.

Oh, cookies! I can't wait to toss them.  
Someone you trust wants to talk to you. 
Who is it this time, my Mother?!  
I've seen a lot, but nothing would ever make me cut out my tongue.
If you yield only to a conqueror, then prepared to be conquered. 
Why don't they just call him Girl George?  
My name is Julius and I'm your TWIN brother. 
Oh obviously! The moment I sat down I though I was looking into a mirror. 
We're not identical twins.  
Can you hurry up. My horse is getting tired. 
You've seen those movies where they say  Make my day.  or  I'm your worst nightmare. , well listen to this one. Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers!
I'm going to throw up all over you. 
Go ahead... won't show on this shirt.  
What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!
If you drop your gun now, I promise I won't kill you. 
That's for sleeping with my wife! 
They're six year olds... how much trouble can they be?  
Your levity is good, it relieves tension and the fear of death.
Surprise, I'm your new cellmate. And I've come to make your life a living hell. Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter... has come at last. 
They even think I'm your girlfriend. 
Well we can straighten that out.. see this camera up there.. I can strangle you for the home audience.  
Capitalism! 
You're luggage! How do you Soviets deal with stress? Vodka 
Are these all your lunches? You mean you eat other peoples' lunches? STOP IT!!!
Leave anything for us? 
Just bodies. 
If it bleeds, we can kill it.  
Hey buddy you want a Turbo Man doll? 
Forget it, I'm not gonna sit on YOUR lap.  
When I die I will have to go before him. And he will ask me 'What is the riddle of steel?' And if I don't know he will cast me out of Valhalla and laugh at me! That's Crom! Strong on his mountain!  
Killian! Here's your Subzero! Now....plain zero! 
So the prince of darkness wants to conquer earth. He has to do it one hour before midnight. Is this eastern time?  
I know now why you cry, but it's something I can never do. To be, or not to be. 
Not to be.  
We'll take Cooke's car. He won't be needing it. 
No more complaining. No more 'Mr. Kimble, I have to go the bathroom'. Nothing! There is no bathroom!  
This isn't a plane, this is a canoe with wings! Then get in and start paddling. 
Benny!! Screw you!! 
The CIA got you pushing too many pencils? So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder.  
What happened? 
They caught a train.  
So who are you man? 
I'm the party pooper. 
When I said you should screw yourself. I didn't mean it literally.  
I suppose nothing hurts you. Only pain.  
It's as satisfying to me as, uh, coming is, you know? As, ah, having sex with a woman and coming. And so can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like, uh, getting the feeling of coming in a gym, I'm getting the feeling of coming at home, I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up, when I pose in front of 5,000 people, I get the same feeling, so I am coming day and night.

Well we can straighten that out.. see this camera up there.. I can strangle you for the home audience.  
Capitalism! 
You're luggage! How do you Soviets deal with stress? Vodka 
Are these all your lunches? You mean you eat other peoples' lunches? STOP IT!!!
Leave anything for us? 
Just bodies. 
If it bleeds, we can kill it.  
Hey buddy you want a Turbo Man doll? 
Forget it, I'm not gonna sit on YOUR lap.  
When I die I will have to go before him. And he will ask me 'What is the riddle of steel?' And if I don't know he will cast me out of Valhalla and laugh at me! That's Crom! Strong on his mountain!  
Killian! Here's your Subzero! Now....plain zero! 
So the prince of darkness wants to conquer earth. He has to do it one hour before midnight. Is this eastern time?  
I know now why you cry, but it's something I can never do. To be, or not to be. 
Not to be.  
We'll take Cooke's car. He won't be needing it. 
No more complaining. No more 'Mr. Kimble, I have to go the bathroom'. Nothing! There is no bathroom!  
This isn't a plane, this is a canoe with wings! Then get in and start paddling. 
Benny!! Screw you!! 
The CIA got you pushing too many pencils? So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder.  
What happened? 
They caught a train.  
So who are you man? 
I'm the party pooper. 
When I said you should screw yourself. I didn't mean it literally.  
I suppose nothing hurts you. Only pain.  
It's as satisfying to me as, uh, coming is, you know? As, ah, having sex with a woman and coming. And so can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like, uh, getting the feeling of coming in a gym, I'm getting the feeling of coming at home, I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up, when I pose in front of 5,000 people, I get the same feeling, so I am coming day and night. I mean, it's terrific. Right? So you know, I am in heaven.  
If revenge is a dish best cold... then put on your Sunday's finest, it's time to feast!  
We had a difference of opinion. I thought my wife and daughter should live. He felt otherwise.  
Come with me if you want to live. 
What's the difference between you and I? 
The difference is, I'm just gonna kill you. 
What the hell are you?  
You're not sending me to the Cooler! 
You gotta be shitting me! 
No. I am not shitting you. 
You gotta be shitting me! 
I am not shitting you.  
Stop whining! You kids are soft. You lack discipline. 
You think you're funny, don't you? 
I know I am. I'm the famous comedian, Arnold Braunschweiger. 
Schwarzenegger! 
Gesundheit. 
Hey Claudius! You killed my father. Big mistake. 
Snakes?! Did you say snakes?!  
Don't break radio silence until they see me. 
How will I know? 
Because all fucking hell is going to break loose. 
The bridge is out!!!  
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 
Uplinks on the ground. Uplinks underground. You guys don't shut up, I'm going to uplink your ass... you'll be on the ground!  
Bucks? Doe? What is all this zoological talk about male and female animals? 
Fuck YOU, asshole!  
First I will turn Gotham into an icy graveyard. Then I will pull Batman's heart from his body and feel it freeze in my hand. 
Come on Cohagen. You got what you want. Give these people air!!  
What happened to Buzzsaw? 
Ahhh.. he had to split.  
Don't disturb my friend... he's dead tired. 
Crom. I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we fought and why we died. No, all that matter's is that two stood against many. That's what is important. Battle pleases you Crom. Grant me one request, grant me revenge. And if you do not listen, then to hell with you!  
Between your faith and my Glock nine millimeter, I'll take the Glock.  
A freeze is coming!  
Let off some steam, Bennett! 
You'd let me die here? No. That's the last thing that will happen to you. First, the air's gonna heat up in here to 451 degrees. than your pass will explode like a Roman candle, your socks will ignite, and your fingernails will melt.  
You should clone yourself while you‚Äôre still alive. 
So I can understand your unique perspective? 
No. So you can go fuck yourself!  
I love you too, sweetheart.
You scared mutha fucka! This green beret is going to kick your ass! 
I eat green berets for breakfast...and I am very hungry!  
Chill-out dickwad.  
Honey, you shouldn't drink and bake. 
Iced that guy!  
Where's Sully? 
I let him go.  
Nice night for a walk.  
I'm pregnant. 
What have you been feeding this thing? 
Blondes! 
Stick around! 
What the hell did you do to him?! 
I did nothing. The pavement was his enemy. 
You bastard! Drop dead! 
I don't do requests. 
It's called the Miranda act.. it says you can't even touch his ass. 
I do not want to touch his ass.. I want to make him talk!  
You want to be a farmer? Here's a couple of acres!  
First I'm gonna use you as a human shield, then I gonna take that chisel and kill the guard with it. Then I was thinking about breaking your neck.  
Milk are for babies, when you get older you drink beer.  
I promise not to kill anyone. 
He'll live. 
Get to the chopper!!  
Conan, what is best in life? 
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women! 
Consider this a divorce!  
I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.  
No, it's not a tumor. It's not a tumor! 
Oh, you think you're bad, huh? You're a fucking choir boy compared to me! A choir boy!!  
Get your ass to Mars
Fuck you, asshole.
Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last?
That's right, Matrix! You did!
I LIED!
Hasta la vista, baby.
You are one ugly motherfucker.
See you at the party, Richter!
I live to see you eat that contract! But I hope you leave enough room for my fist, because I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine!
Are you Sarah Conner?
Have you ever killed anyone?
Yes, but they were all bad!
I'll be back.
Nice night for a walk.
Nothing clean.  Right.
Your clothes.  Give them to me. Now. 
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
Wrong.
This is One-Four-Three.  West-bound on Olympic, approaching Overland.
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she is here.  Can I see her, please?
Where is she?
I'll come back. 
Fuck you, asshole.
Hello.
Tell me your address there.
I'm Reese, sergeant, TechCom DN38416 assigned to protect you. You've been targeted for termination...It's very important that you live....(The Terminator) He's not a man - a machine. A Terminator. A Cyberdyne Systems Model 101...Not a robot. A cyborg. A cybernetic organism...The Terminator's an infiltration unit, part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis - microprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough. But outside, it's living human tissue - flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs...The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new, they look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot...

Cyborgs don't feel pain, I do. Don't do that again. (Sarah: "Just let me go!") Listen, and understand! That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!

You set us up! It‚Äôs all bullshit, all of it! The Cabinet Minister, the whole business. Got us in here to do your dirty work. ‚Ä¶ shut up! Shut up! ‚Ä¶ So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into a meat grinder! What happened here Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust.

The usual. More money, more freedom, more air.

I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any second.

The chairman defended the attack, saying that space-based weapons are our only defense against the southern block's numerical superiority. And more violence last night on Mars where terrorists demanding independence once again halted the extraction of terbinium ore. Kuato and his so called freedom brigade claimed credit for this latest bombing, which attempted to reopen the sealed off Pyramid Mines. Mars military restored order with minimal use of force and all damage to the strategic facility was repaired within hours.

Conan! What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.

Oh, cookies! I can't wait to toss them.  
Someone you trust wants to talk to you. 
Who is it this time, my Mother?!  
I've seen a lot, but nothing would ever make me cut out my tongue.
If you yield only to a conqueror, then prepared to be conquered. 
Why don't they just call him Girl George?  
My name is Julius and I'm your TWIN brother. 
Oh obviously! The moment I sat down I though I was looking into a mirror. 
We're not identical twins.  
Can you hurry up. My horse is getting tired. 
You've seen those movies where they say  Make my day.  or  I'm your worst nightmare. , well listen to this one. Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers!
I'm going to throw up all over you. 
Go ahead... won't show on this shirt.  
What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!
If you drop your gun now, I promise I won't kill you. 
That's for sleeping with my wife! 
They're six year olds... how much trouble can they be?  
Your levity is good, it relieves tension and the fear of death.
Surprise, I'm your new cellmate. And I've come to make your life a living hell. Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter... has come at last. 
They even think I'm your girlfriend.

Fuck you, asshole.
Hello.
Tell me your address there.


I am so happy to get to be with you all, and it‚Äôs pretty cool to see some of the College Republicans sitting down here where we met last time. I met some of you in the lobby, in addition to some of the great Independents and Libertarians who were out there too. They are awesome, and then last night meeting some of our proud, wonderful members of the military. I love you guys; you‚Äôre my heroes. I love you cause I love freedom, and like I always say, if you love your freedom, thank a Vet. We thank you guys.

It‚Äôs really, really good to be here today. I love coming back here because there are always so many young people, or, as you‚Äôre know by the folks across the river, ‚ÄòObamaCare suckers [suckas]. Yep, you are the ones, right? You‚Äôre the ones who pay the bills in our brave new world. They forgot that, didn‚Äôt they, when they said that you were the change that you were waiting for. Turns out, you have the change that they‚Äôre waiting for. You have the change, you have the fives, you have the tens, and twenties.

Well, it is great to be back here, because this is the place, CPAC is known as the place, where the future conservatism always starts; whether it was Ronald Reagan back in ‚Äô75 or Dr. Ben Carson, just like last year, this is where it starts, and it‚Äôs because of you and your energy, your commitment to the greatest, the greatest country on earth, the thing that makes her exceptional. It‚Äôs because of you. So I look at you and I feel good about America.

Now, when we were here last year, there was some reeling going on because of the election. Our fellow Americans had decided, evidently, to double-down on hopey-changey, and the Sages of the Beltway and their sock puppets at MSLSD, hat tip Mark Levin ‚Äî they said that we had to give up on our principles, because they said, the train of history was roaring to the left so jump onboard or get left behind; but then, something happened, that ‚Äòhope and change‚Äô went from a catchy campaign slogan to a reality, and along the way, ‚Äòhope and change,‚Äô ‚Äòyes we can,‚Äô it became ‚Äòno you can‚Äôt, nooooo, you can‚Äôt log on to the website, nooooo you can‚Äôt keep your health care, nooooo you can‚Äôt make a phone call without Michelle Obama knowing this is the third time this week you‚Äôve dialed Pizza Hut delivery.

Yes, something did happen. We became a wiser Republican a year ago. Americans know now what the giants of our movement have always told us, people like Freidman and Reagan and Margaret Thatcher ‚Äî they said, there ain‚Äôt no such thing as a free lunch. There is no free birth control. There‚Äôs no free phone. There‚Äôs no free doctor visits. There‚Äôs no free Fritos, there‚Äôs no free ride. Someone pays. Someone always pays, and if you don‚Äôt know who that someone is, it‚Äôs probably you. Americans found that out this year, and hopefully those socially-engineering politicos learned something as well. Americans aren‚Äôt quite as obedient as they thought we were.

See, they set up a lot of hoops, making us pay for insurance that we don‚Äôt want, don‚Äôt need, telling us, ah, nothing to see in Benghazi, move along, move along, nor at the IRS, nothing amiss, not even a smidgen ‚Äî making us bear the brunt of that dopey wobbling on the world stage, but we didn‚Äôt jump through those hoops the way that we were supposed to. It‚Äôs like, y‚Äôall went rogue! [applause] I thank you!

Speaking of y‚Äôall, Texas, thank you, thank you Texas, because liberty needs a Congress on Cruz Control.

Yes, last year something did happen; the awakening did begin and Senator Ted Cruz helped keep them awake. His filibuster, it worked in waking people up to the folly of a government take-over of one-sixth of our economy. He forced debate. He told his colleagues, it was time, time to stand-up, time to use the tools of the Constitution, the power of the purse to fulfill their campaign promises and to stop ObamaCare, but our Army balked. We hoped that they were just reloading, but instead, they retreated, and worse, worse, they joined the lap dogs in the lame stream to trash the foot soldiers who had fought for America.

Ted Cruz, he had a clever way of doing it, too. Dr. Seuss, who‚Äôd a thunk? Who‚Äôd a thunk? [audience member calls out 'read to us.'] Yeah, good idea, maybe I‚Äôll just ad lib something, yeah, right sure. But there he was reading it on the floor of the Senate, through air waves, he was telling his kids, I‚Äôm thinking of you, thinking of all our kids. I have five kids. I have five kids so reading Green Eggs and Ham over all those years, to each one, you know, you totally have it memorized by, especially by the time Trig was born, so I had to spice it up a bit, and little Trig, lucky little fella, his bedtime story, now it goes something like this:

I do not like this Uncle Sam
I do not like his health care scam
I do not like these dirty crooks or
How they lie and cook the books.
I do not like when Congress steals
I do not like their crony deals
I do not like this spying man
I do not like ‚ÄòOh yes we can
I do not like this spending spree,
We‚Äôre smart, we know there‚Äôs nothing free
I do not like reporter‚Äôs smug replies
When I complain about their lies
I do not like this kind of hope, and
We wont‚Äô take it nope, nope, nope

Hat tip the internet. I saw a couple of lines on the internet on that, and I winged the other ones.

Friends, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee and Paul and Gowdy and Gosar and Gohmert, etc., we‚Äôve got some good guys in there, good guys, they carry the Common Sense gene. They know that we are a nation with a government, not the other way around. They are constitutionalists and they were sent to D.C. to fight the battle there for us, so it‚Äôs time, it‚Äôs time we send them reinforcements.

They need reinforcements, because you see, families are hurting today, hard workers, hard-working families. They‚Äôre caught between the capitalism that benefits the politically-connected and the income redistribution that benefits the politically-favored.

But still, I feel good about America because Conservatives haven‚Äôt forgotten the American beyond the ruling classes, wealthy D.C. suburbs. I‚Äôm talking about the places where most of the people who do the working and the serving and the building and the taxpaying live. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find amazing America.

We are staying true to our principles ‚Äî real solutions to real problems, and you got to hear some of those solutions the last couple of days. You‚Äôre not just sitting back, just hanging, hanging with the ‚ÄòChoom Gang [see photo below], I hope your not, just letting D.C. control the people and bankrupt our country in order to fundamentally transform it.

That‚Äôs why I feel good, because you‚Äôre not just putting up with this. We do have some great pro-freedom, free market, pro-family that are clingers and wingers, aka great leaders, and they‚Äôre proposing ways to actually help the middle class and allow equal opportunity to work, and through self initiative, everyone be lifted and succeed, so I feel good.

I hear from you and I see you. I just feel that we know we‚Äôve got each other‚Äôs backs and I feel that you know this is the stirring of the Great Awakening. I do believe that the eyes of America are open, unfortunately though, some would want you to just hit the snooze button and roll back over, like, ‚Äòhush America, go back to sleep little lambs. Go back to sleep, close those eyes.‚Äô Some of these folks are in the establishment, and they are a different breed of cats. They say that the smartest thing that we can do right now is just lay low, stay out-of-the-way while ObamaCare crashes and burns on its own and the economy sputters to a halt ‚Äî forget all that solvency and insolvency stuff, just lay low, and as, while internationally, we so tick-off our allies and we lead a world that is looking for that shining city on a hill again, we lead them from behind? The result is some very, very, very bad dudes gain ground. This, instead of putting the fear of God in our enemies ‚Äî proving peace through strength, and that is only brought to you courtesy of the red, white and blue. That‚Äôs only what the United States military can do.

But some GOP experts, they subscribe to the old saying, you know, don‚Äôt interrupt while they‚Äôre in the process of destroying themselves. Maybe true, but you do interrupt when they are in the process of destroying your country. So that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to do. We‚Äôre going to stop ‚Äòem 2014. We‚Äôre going to stop them, and by the way, complacent ones who had just shined the boot that would stop on our necks, working the status agenda of Obama, this applies to you too in the 2016 presidential race. [audience chants 'run Sarah run.'] Speaking of‚Ä¶I should have, I didn‚Äôt get to run this morning, I was so busy man, [inaudible, something about yoga] and didn‚Äôt get to run.

But speaking of those who just carry the water, man, I feel sorry for some of those Cabinet members, frankly ‚Äî take Secretary of State John Kerry [audience reacts]. You say  take him, take him?  No really, I feel sorry because it‚Äôs just draining on him. He does not look happy. He has sent a message that this president is dazed and confused. Poor guy, you can just see it on him. Bless his heart, but no need to ask him any more why the long face [laughter]. Now we know.

Those policies that the Cabinet have to explain and justify, how do you convey to Putin the threat that sounds like ‚ÄòVladimir, don‚Äôt mess around, or you‚Äôre going to feel my flexibility, cause I got a phone and I got a pen and, um, I can dial real fast and poke you with my pen. Pinky promise.‚Äô

No, this is the guy who promised to provide for the sick, but there are more uninsured today than when Obama began this. He promised jobs for the jobless but fewer people work today than since the peanut farmer was our president, and the average family is bringing in $4,000 dollars less today than when Obama started all this. He promised us a safe peaceful world, promised he‚Äôs got al-Qaeda on the run, yeah, perhaps towards us. And safer? He would gut our arsenal, he allows others, enemies, to enrich theirs. Man, that‚Äôs just like a liberal on gun control. Mr. President, the only thing that stops a bad guy with a nuke is a good guy with a nuke. [big applause - inaudible].

He promised to heal the planet and stop the raise of the oceans, but the planet‚Äôs not listening to Dr. Obama.

The only thing rising in his la-la land is the Russian empire. I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm probably being too hard on the president, after all, who could have seen this coming? [huge laughter].

The GOP establishment, again, just going along to get along. You need another ‚Äòcome to Jesus meetin.‚Äô It‚Äôs time, and the bottom line is today/ The Democrat‚Äôs agenda is a lost cause. President Obama, though, he is nothing if not poll-tested, so even he knows that the deep issue of our time is that pressing stagnation facing the middle class. Those good working class families, just can‚Äôt get ahead and that‚Äôs why he baits the GOP establishment into a kind of tit-for-tat, things to distract, and then they pander, and in the White House they do such damage, but their agenda is failure and fiasco on steroids.

America is counting on the GOP to get it right, and that‚Äôs why the establishment can‚Äôt blow it. No Republican gets elected promising higher taxes, wasteful spending, increased debt, bigger government, rewarding lawbreakers, amnesty ‚Äî so why are they voting for these things now, and why reward them with your vote?

GOP Beltway Boys, yeah, GOP Beltway Boys, you know that 2010 victory that swept you into power? You didn‚Äôt build that, the TEA Party did, [huge applause] so dance with the one that brought ya. You want another sweep, grab a broom and join us at the party.

In this awakening, eyes are open, we‚Äôre stronger now, we‚Äôre wiser now, and God knows, we are hungry and there aren‚Äôt enough low-information voters in the country to save the other side this time, if we don‚Äôt retreat. And when we meet next, Lord willing, Harry Reid ‚Äî either he will be the Senate minority leader or a blackjack dealer in Vegas, where everything stays in Vegas.

Another reason to feel good about our future and our movement, because we are pushing back against what some would call the ‚Äòperpetual panties-in-a-wad‚Äô people. You know them, these people are quick with quote about the latest victimized identity group. They are professionals at taking offense. It‚Äôs what they do, and their media minions are even quicker, seeking them out and publicizing their manufactured outrage. The play is always the same, someone on the right says something that isn‚Äôt politically correct, or it can be distorted not to sound politically correct, and it‚Äôs ‚Äòperpetually wadded-up people‚Äô that they get to work and they claim to want tolerance, open debate and their goal really is the complete opposite. Their goal is to shut-up anyone who doesn‚Äôt toe their line. What ever happened ‚Äî you see or hear something, that kind of bugged you ‚Äî buck up or stay in the truck? That‚Äôs how we grew up.

Remember when their skirts got all tangled-up over their heads when, recently, our buddy from Duck Dynasty, Phil ‚Äî remember this? Here‚Äôs Phil, he‚Äôs talking about faith with a reporter from GQ, first mistake, but in between saying he loves humanity, he loves sinners, and leave it to God to judge. Well, he quoted the Bible and he got colorful with expressing his opinion, so what did that brilliant TV network do? They fired him. They canned the devout Christian for expressing his devout Christian views on a television show about his devout Christian family. Yeah, there‚Äôs nothing wrong, nothing out of line on cable TV, it‚Äôs those executives who get to school America on standards.

In another time though, that might have been it. Phil would have stayed fired, but not now, not this time, people all over America knew. It wasn‚Äôt just wingers and clingers, people all over America knew that Phil‚Äôs right to express himself, that fight that he had to undertake, well, that was all about our right to express ourselves. His fight was our fight and we pushed back and we won. And now everyone is happy, happy, happy.

You know, these are the same ‚Äòfainting couch liberals,‚Äô whining that we disrespect women. Bull. Hey, Democrats, it is your leaders who are demeaning to women. Liberals seem to think that the women of America are just cheap dates, you know, feed ‚Äòem a few lines about that free birth control, throw in a few scary quotes on the War on Women, then they will be yours. Don‚Äôt bother their pretty little heads with tax policy or debilitating debt or energy independence. Imagine if they treated the men like that? A quick word with the sisters here ‚Äî guys just give us a minute, go play some racing game on your cell phone or something for a second, okay, while I talk to the ladies.

Girls, we know better than to fall for that victimization-line from the president and his party. I know you know better, but if you have a friend or a sister or a roommate, falling for that hooey, you gotta set ‚Äòem straight. Ask them, who‚Äôs really stereotyping you? Is it the people who believe you are a thinking, achieving, striving strong individual or those who put you in a box and they define you still by body parts. Enticing girls to think they need these guys to grow government to take care of them.

Women, don‚Äôt let them use you unless you choose to be their political pawn or just their piece of accessory on their arm. Honey, that‚Äôs not liberation, that‚Äôs subjugation and this sisterhood fights against that. We fight the mastery the big government would want over us, so who are the real women liberators? Hey, you can join us, be legit, because, come on libs, can you really sing, ‚ÄòI am woman hear me‚Ä¶.‚Äô No, cause donkeys just bray, only Mamma Grizzlies say ‚Äòhear me roar.‚Äô

Let the women of America know our platform, our values, our independence, our work ethics. It‚Äôs family, faith and freedom. Be bold in making our case. We‚Äôre the heirs of Thatcher and Stanton and Anthony so stop apologizing, and start evangelizing and infiltrating, and influencing pop culture. If the boys aren‚Äôt up for the challenge, the girls are happy to lead the charge. This sisterhood so believes in respect, the powerful and purposeful potential of every woman so much so that we‚Äôre the party with the plank that protects even our littlest sisters in the womb.

Friends, last year I stood here and I declared that we‚Äôre not here to rebrand a party, we‚Äôre here to rebuild a country and what I meant was, we shouldn‚Äôt be in the business of using just the right poll-tested phraseology or pander to the right special interests. We‚Äôre in the business of digging ourselves out of debt, and restoring competitiveness, educating our children, and liberating our potential.

Truth be told, coming from a very diverse family and having a diverse career and being independent, I don‚Äôt care what you call yourself or how you rebrand a party. If you stand for those right things, I stand with you, and to stand here is to stand on the shoulder‚Äôs of giants.

The men and women who have come before, at podiums like this, in front of patriots like you ‚Äî you‚Äôre the key ‚Äî you‚Äôre what matters in all of this. But they, coming before, devoting their lives to preserving and protecting what is best in us ‚Äî some were veterans, some were politicians, some housewives, speaking to soldiers, students and teachers, firemen, fishermen, farmers, of every race, color and creed ‚Äî all were parts of a remarkable movement of freedom and human flourishing and for all they have given us, for all they have achieved, such a great price they paid ‚Äî in their honor, work hard and feel good, knowing that the best is yet to come.

This is a great awakening. The Age of Obama is almost over ‚Äî the end of an error. He is the lamest of lame ducks, so expand our ranks. We can do this. Expand our ranks to save our country, because our sensible and aperitiv [?] mission for small government and big freedom is big enough for every American who loves liberty and trusts the individual. I know this because we know America, not from the top down but from the heart looking out.

Our message resonates. We believe in the promise of America, and that message does resonate and it has since the band of brothers dumped tea in the Boston harbor. We have to go be that band of brothers and sisters again, not to fundamentally change America but to save it and to fundamentally restore the promise of America. It is because of you, it‚Äôs We the People, because of you that I have never been more optimistic about the future of our one nation, under God, so stand up and stiffen your spine, you‚Äôve got to fight for it, the best is yet to come. God bless you Conservatives. God bless America.

Mr. Chairman, delegates, and fellow citizens: I am honored to be considered for the nomination for vice president of the United States.

I accept the call to help our nominee for president to serve and defend America.

I accept the challenge of a tough fight in this election against confident opponents at a crucial hour for our country.

And I accept the privilege of serving with a man who has come through much harder missions ... and met far graver challenges and knows how tough fights are won ‚Äî the next president of the United States, John S. McCain.

It was just a year ago when all the experts in Washington counted out our nominee because he refused to hedge his commitment to the security of the country he loves.

With their usual certitude, they told us that all was lost ‚Äî there was no hope for this candidate who said that he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war.

But the pollsters and pundits overlooked just one thing when they wrote him off.

They overlooked the caliber of the man himself ‚Äî the determination, resolve, and sheer guts of Sen. John McCain. The voters knew better.

And maybe that's because they realize there is a time for politics and a time for leadership ... a time to campaign and a time to put our country first.

Our nominee for president is a true profile in courage, and people like that are hard to come by.

He's a man who wore the uniform of this country for 22 years and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who have now brought victory within sight.

And as the mother of one of those troops, that is exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief. I'm just one of many moms who'll say an extra prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm's way.

Our son Track is 19.

And one week from tomorrow ‚Äî Sept. 11 ‚Äî he'll deploy to Iraq with the Army infantry in the service of his country.

My nephew Kasey also enlisted and serves on a carrier in the Persian Gulf.

My family is proud of both of them and of all the fine men and women serving the country in uniform. Track is the eldest of our five children.

In our family, it's two boys and three girls in between ‚Äî my strong and kind-hearted daughters, Bristol, Willow and Piper.

And in April, my husband, Todd, and I welcomed our littlest one into the world, a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig. From the inside, no family ever seems typical.

That's how it is with us.

Our family has the same ups and downs as any other ‚Äî the same challenges and the same joys.

Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge.

And children with special needs inspire a special love.

To the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters.

I pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House. Todd is a story all by himself.

He's a lifelong commercial fisherman ... a production operator in the oil fields of Alaska's North Slope ... a proud member of the United Steel Workers Union ... and world champion snow machine racer.

Throw in his Yup'ik Eskimo ancestry, and it all makes for quite a package.

We met in high school, and two decades and five children later he's still my guy. My mom and dad both worked at the elementary school in our small town.

And among the many things I owe them is one simple lesson: that this is America, and every woman can walk through every door of opportunity.

My parents are here tonight, and I am so proud to be the daughter of Chuck and Sally Heath. Long ago, a young farmer and haberdasher from Missouri followed an unlikely path to the vice presidency.

A writer observed:  We grow good people in our small towns, with honesty, sincerity, and dignity.  I know just the kind of people that writer had in mind when he praised Harry Truman.

I grew up with those people.

They are the ones who do some of the hardest work in America who grow our food, run our factories and fight our wars.

They love their country, in good times and bad, and they're always proud of America. I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town.

I was just your average hockey mom and signed up for the PTA because I wanted to make my kids' public education better.

When I ran for City Council, I didn't need focus groups and voter profiles because I knew those voters, and knew their families, too.

Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska, I was mayor of my hometown.

And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves.

I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a  community organizer,  except that you have actual responsibilities. I might add that in small towns, we don't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening, and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people aren't listening.

We tend to prefer candidates who don't talk about us one way in Scranton and another way in San Francisco.

As for my running mate, you can be certain that wherever he goes, and whoever is listening, John McCain is the same man. I'm not a member of the permanent political establishment. And I've learned quickly, these past few days, that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone.

But here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion. I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country. Americans expect us to go to Washington for the right reasons, and not just to mingle with the right people.

Politics isn't just a game of clashing parties and competing interests.

The right reason is to challenge the status quo, to serve the common good, and to leave this nation better than we found it.

No one expects us to agree on everything.

But we are expected to govern with integrity, good will, clear convictions, and ... a servant's heart.

I pledge to all Americans that I will carry myself in this spirit as vice president of the United States. This was the spirit that brought me to the governor's office, when I took on the old politics as usual in Juneau ... when I stood up to the special interests, the lobbyists, big oil companies, and the good-ol' boys network.

Sudden and relentless reform never sits well with entrenched interests and power brokers. That's why true reform is so hard to achieve.

But with the support of the citizens of Alaska, we shook things up.

And in short order we put the government of our state back on the side of the people.

I came to office promising major ethics reform, to end the culture of self-dealing. And today, that ethics reform is the law.

While I was at it, I got rid of a few things in the governor's office that I didn't believe our citizens should have to pay for.

That luxury jet was over the top. I put it on eBay.

I also drive myself to work.

And I thought we could muddle through without the governor's personal chef ‚Äî although I've got to admit that sometimes my kids sure miss her. I came to office promising to control spending ‚Äî by request if possible and by veto if necessary.

Sen. McCain also promises to use the power of veto in defense of the public interest ‚Äî and as a chief executive, I can assure you it works.

Our state budget is under control.

We have a surplus.

And I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending: nearly half a billion dollars in vetoes.

I suspended the state fuel tax and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress.

I told the Congress  thanks, but no thanks,  for that Bridge to Nowhere.

If our state wanted a bridge, we'd build it ourselves. When oil and gas prices went up dramatically, and filled up the state treasury, I sent a large share of that revenue back where it belonged ‚Äî directly to the people of Alaska.

And despite fierce opposition from oil company lobbyists, who kind of liked things the way they were, we broke their monopoly on power and resources.

As governor, I insisted on competition and basic fairness to end their control of our state and return it to the people.

I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history.

And when that deal was struck, we began a nearly 40 billion-dollar natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence.

That pipeline, when the last section is laid and its valves are opened, will lead America one step farther away from dependence on dangerous foreign powers that do not have our interests at heart.

The stakes for our nation could not be higher.

When a hurricane strikes in the Gulf of Mexico, this country should not be so dependent on imported oil that we are forced to draw from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

And families cannot throw away more and more of their paychecks on gas and heating oil.

With Russia wanting to control a vital pipeline in the Caucasus, and to divide and intimidate our European allies by using energy as a weapon, we cannot leave ourselves at the mercy of foreign suppliers.

To confront the threat that Iran might seek to cut off nearly a fifth of world energy supplies ... or that terrorists might strike again at the Abqaiq facility in Saudi Arabia ... or that Venezuela might shut off its oil deliveries ... we Americans need to produce more of our own oil and gas.

And take it from a gal who knows the North Slope of Alaska: We've got lots of both.

Our opponents say, again and again, that drilling will not solve all of America's energy problems ‚Äî as if we all didn't know that already.

But the fact that drilling won't solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all.

Starting in January, in a McCain-Palin administration, we're going to lay more pipelines ... build more nuclear plants ... create jobs with clean coal ... and move forward on solar, wind, geothermal and other alternative sources.

We need American energy resources, brought to you by American ingenuity, and produced by American workers. I've noticed a pattern with our opponent.

Maybe you have, too.

We've all heard his dramatic speeches before devoted followers.

And there is much to like and admire about our opponent.

But listening to him speak, it's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform ‚Äî not even in the state Senate.

This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting and never use the word  victory  except when he's talking about his own campaign. But when the cloud of rhetoric has passed ... when the roar of the crowd fades away ... when the stadium lights go out, and those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot ‚Äî what exactly is our opponent's plan? What does he actually seek to accomplish, after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet? The answer is to make government bigger ... take more of your money ... give you more orders from Washington ... and to reduce the strength of America in a dangerous world. America needs more energy ... our opponent is against producing it.

Victory in Iraq is finally in sight ... he wants to forfeit.

Terrorist states are seeking nuclear weapons without delay ... he wants to meet them without preconditions.

Al-Qaida terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America ... he's worried that someone won't read them their rights? Government is too big ... he wants to grow it.

Congress spends too much ... he promises more.

Taxes are too high ... he wants to raise them. His tax increases are the fine print in his economic plan, and let me be specific.

The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes ... raise payroll taxes ... raise investment income taxes ... raise the death tax ... raise business taxes ... and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars. My sister Heather and her husband have just built a service station that's now opened for business ‚Äî like millions of others who run small businesses.

How are they going to be any better off if taxes go up? Or maybe you're trying to keep your job at a plant in Michigan or Ohio ... or create jobs with clean coal from Pennsylvania or West Virginia ... or keep a small farm in the family right here in Minnesota.

How are you going to be better off if our opponent adds a massive tax burden to the American economy? Here's how I look at the choice Americans face in this election.

In politics, there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers.

And then there are those, like John McCain, who use their careers to promote change.

They're the ones whose names appear on laws and landmark reforms, not just on buttons and banners, or on self-designed presidential seals.

Among politicians, there is the idealism of high-flown speechmaking, in which crowds are stirringly summoned to support great things.

And then there is the idealism of those leaders, like John McCain, who actually do great things. They're the ones who are good for more than talk ... the ones we have always been able to count on to serve and defend America. Sen. McCain's record of actual achievement and reform helps explain why so many special interests, lobbyists and comfortable committee chairmen in Congress have fought the prospect of a McCain presidency ‚Äî from the primary election of 2000 to this very day.

Our nominee doesn't run with the Washington herd.

He's a man who's there to serve his country, and not just his party.

A leader who's not looking for a fight, but is not afraid of one either. Harry Reid, the majority leader of the current do-nothing Senate, not long ago summed up his feelings about our nominee.

He said, quote,  I can't stand John McCain.  Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps no accolade we hear this week is better proof that we've chosen the right man. Clearly what the majority leader was driving at is that he can't stand up to John McCain. That is only one more reason to take the maverick of the Senate and put him in the White House. My fellow citizens, the American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of  personal discovery.  This world of threats and dangers is not just a community, and it doesn't just need an organizer.

And though both Sen. Obama and Sen. Biden have been going on lately about how they are always, quote,  fighting for you,  let us face the matter squarely.

There is only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you ... in places where winning means survival and defeat means death ... and that man is John McCain. In our day, politicians have readily shared much lesser tales of adversity than the nightmare world in which this man, and others equally brave, served and suffered for their country.

It's a long way from the fear and pain and squalor of a 6-by-4 cell in Hanoi to the Oval Office.

But if Sen. McCain is elected president, that is the journey he will have made.

It's the journey of an upright and honorable man ‚Äî the kind of fellow whose name you will find on war memorials in small towns across this country, only he was among those who came home.

To the most powerful office on Earth, he would bring the compassion that comes from having once been powerless ... the wisdom that comes even to the captives, by the grace of God ... the special confidence of those who have seen evil, and seen how evil is overcome. A fellow prisoner of war, a man named Tom Moe of Lancaster, Ohio, recalls looking through a pinhole in his cell door as Lt. Cmdr. John McCain was led down the hallway, by the guards, day after day.

As the story is told,  When McCain shuffled back from torturous interrogations, he would turn toward Moe's door and flash a grin and thumbs up  ‚Äî as if to say,  We're going to pull through this.  My fellow Americans, that is the kind of man America needs to see us through these next four years.

For a season, a gifted speaker can inspire with his words.

For a lifetime, John McCain has inspired with his deeds.

If character is the measure in this election ... and hope the theme ... and change the goal we share, then I ask you to join our cause. Join our cause and help America elect a great man as the next president of the United States.

Thank you all, and may God bless America.


 I see the United States as being a force for good in the world. And as Ronald Reagan used to talk about, America being the beacon of light and hope for those who are seeking democratic values and tolerance and freedom. I see our country being able to represent those things that can be looked to ‚Ä¶ as that leadership, that light needed across the world.



I'm not one of those who maybe came from a background of, you know, kids who perhaps graduate college and their parents give them a passport and give them a backpack and say go off and travel the world.

No, I've worked all my life. In fact, I usually had two jobs all my life until I had kids. I was not a part of, I guess, that culture. The way that I have understood the world is through education, through books, through mediums that have provided me a lot of perspective on the world.

Because we can't afford to lose in Afghanistan, as we cannot afford to lose in Iraq, either, these central fronts on the war on terror. And I asked President Karzai,  Is that what you are seeking, also? That strategy that has worked in Iraq that John McCain had pushed for, more troops? A counterinsurgency strategy?  And he said,  yes.  And he also showed great appreciation for what America and American troops are providing in his country.

I don't believe that new President Zardari has that mission at all. But no, the Pakistani people also, they want freedom. They want democratic values to be allowed in their country, also. They understand the dangers of terrorists having a stronghold in regions of their country, also. And I believe that they, too, want to rid not only their country, but the world, of violent Islamic terrorists.

That Alaska has a very narrow maritime border between a foreign country, Russia, and, on our other side, the land-boundary that we have with Canada. It's funny that a comment like that was kinda made to ‚Ä¶ I don't know, you know ‚Ä¶ reporters.

Yeah, mocked, I guess that's the word, yeah.

Well, it certainly does, because our, our next-door neighbors are foreign countries, there in the state that I am the executive of. And there‚Ä¶

We have trade missions back and forth, we do. It's very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia. As Putin rears his head and comes into the air space of the United States of America, where do they go? It's Alaska. It's just right over the border. It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation, Russia, because they are right there, they are right next to our state.

Specifically, we will make every effort possible to help spread democracy for those who desire freedom, independence, tolerance, respect for equality. That is the whole goal here in fighting terrorism also. It's not just to keep the people safe, but to be able to usher in democratic values and ideals around this, around the world.

I think, with Ahmadinejad, personally, he is not one to negotiate with. You can't just sit down with him with no preconditions being met. Barack Obama is so off-base in his proclamation that he would meet with some of these leaders around our world who would seek to destroy America and that, and without preconditions being met. That's beyond na√Øve. And it's beyond bad judgment.

It's dangerous.

I've never heard Henry Kissinger say,  Yeah, I'll meet with these leaders without preconditions being met.  Diplomacy is about doing a lot of background work first and shoring up allies and positions and figuring out what sanctions perhaps could be implemented if things weren't gonna go right. That's part of diplomacy.

We shouldn't second guess Israel's security efforts because we cannot ever afford to send a message that we would allow a second Holocaust, for one. Israel has got to have the opportunity and the ability to protect itself. They are our closest ally in the Mideast. We need them. They need us. And we shouldn't second guess their efforts.

No, abso ‚Ä¶ we need to express our rights and our concerns and ‚Ä¶

We don't have to second-guess what their efforts would be if they believe ‚Ä¶ that it is in their country and their allies, including us, all of our best interests to fight against a regime, especially Iran, who would seek to wipe them off the face of the earth. It is obvious to me who the good guys are in this one and who the bad guys are. The bad guys are the ones who say Israel is a stinking corpse and should be wiped off the face of the earth. That's not a good guy who is saying that. Now, one who would seek to protect the good guys in this, the leaders of Israel and her friends, her allies, including the United States, in my world, those are the good guys.

He's got good domestic policy solutions that he wants to see implemented. He wants to rein in spending. He wants to limit the federal government's overreach. And I support that, and I'm happy to support him. Obviously, will not be agreeing with him on everything. He didn't agree with me on everything.

I, there will be plenty of things I'm sure, but no I'm happy to support him and I think this whole relationship that I will have with Dr. Paul is going to be I think reflective of other candidates that people may raise their eyebrows and say, why are you supporting them in a primary? I will do this when many of the positions can be supported but also my position on supporting competitive, rigorous contested primaries is very important.

Absolutely, because I do want competition to allow the cream of the crop to rise.
Yeah, whatever they need me to do.

Yeah, sure, sure, depending on what position we're in √¢‚Ç¨¬¶.

No doubt there are candidates who will not seek my support because some will perceive me as being too polarizing and if they're in more liberal districts or states they won't want someone like me who has been unfortunately by the media put in a box as being so parochial and myopic in terms of some positions that they won't recognize my own independence. So some people will shy away from my support that I could offer. But those who recognize that I do have strong opinions, a very strong independent streak in me and a lot of common sense and if they ask for my help, I'm gonna give it to them.

Many of the Democrats who are continuing to support President Obama's misguided decisions like in Nevada, I will do whatever I can to help the other side of the aisle. Certainly in the general, because Reid's gotta go, and as for the primary right now I really like them both -- that's what my problem is, but we still have quite a few, quite a number of days to figure out what is best for the GOP in Nevada to help them out to defeat Reid and of course that's an easy one too, though, if the election were today, Reid goes, he would go down.

That's going too far because I do not have that power nor desire.

I think the logistics of how it goes back -- I don't know if it goes through the PAC or not, I haven't talked to PAC treasurers or attorneys about it. I'm keeping it simple. I'm committing to not personally ...

Well the tea party is not a party but those who believe in what the tea party is all about -- limited government and a strong national security policy coming out of D.C., yeah I'm gonna support 'em.

The ones that I've already talked about and others that are on the docket.

We've already donated to Rand.

Yes we already have.

It is yet to be determined. There are hundreds of candidates on local, state and on the national level that hopefully we'll be able to help. Don't know how many and don't know specifically which ones it'll be today.

I said he shouldn't be in the president's inner circle calling the shots, policy decisions that are being made that affect Americans, he shouldn't be in the inner circle. That's what I called for.

Oh I think he needs to go for a variety of reasons. I think he gives horrible advice to our president obviously and I think he and some of the other president's advisers need to go. Look who the president has chosen with Van Jones and some of these other characters. I think if even if President Obama had a do-over he would ask for some changes in his administration.

Well right now we're talking about ra--, we're talking about ---- Holder is giving poor advice on how we are to treat these terrorists, to bestow upon these terrorists the constitutional rights that our men and women in uniform fight and die for. These terrorists do not deserve these protections. And yet we are choosing, according to the White House, we are to choose to give them these protections. That's nonsense, they do not deserve these protections

He, just like Rahm Emanuel for a variety of reasons. I look forward as a matter of fact, to three years from now when the White House dramatically is shifted in terms of persons calling the shots.

Special-needs parents reached out to me and obviously they know me well enough to know that I am sincere in my efforts to make this world a more welcoming place for those with special needs. I made that commitment during the GOP convention speech. They knew that they could come to me and ask and I was happy to do it, I'd do it again in a heartbeat and I'm not politically correct, I am not a word police person but there are some things, especially coming from the most powerful office in the world, in the free world, the chief of staff in that office being so demeaning and degrading to those with special needs. And remember too it's not as benign as the White House wants to spin this into. He didn't just use the r-word applying it to a plan, he called opponents of a plan f'ing retards. That's demeaning, degrading, it's beneath the dignity of the White House. That alone should I think make the president ask for that do-over with his chief of staff.

Yeah he did, and so that pattern there --

I sure did, I did. I was the governor then and I made a statement saying you know, insensitive, come on, coming from the most powerful man in the free world, you should do better than that, Mr. President. Yeah I made a statement about that and was criticized for that too, but I don't care -- I √¢‚Ç¨Àúm not gonna sit down and shut up. I'm gonna tell people that this pattern of not just the insensitivity, but the flippant way of perhaps looking at those who are less fortunate and are not part of that elite crowd there in Washington I'm sick of it and I'm gonna stand up and I'm gonna say something about it because I think I'm speaking on behalf of others who are concerned about it.

I don't believe that I have to join any word or police thing or organization √¢‚Ç¨  I can speak out independently and say come on Mr. Emanuel enough is enough of that and Mr. President, come on, let's be civil, let's be professional and worthy of the positions that you have in the White House.

The tea party movement is beautiful. It's a grassroots effort -- not a well-oiled machine that is replicated with the Dems or the Republicans thank goodness, because hopefully personalities and power struggles and titles won't get in the way of just doing what is right for this country and that's what the tea party's all about. Let's do what's right for this country, let's let our voice be heard on reminding Congress that we are taxed enough already. There are constitutional limits to what our federal government is trying to do, we're gonna remind them of that, and we are going to respect our Constitution and do all that we can to protect it.

It absolutely helps, no, and those who are fearful about it and those who are trying to stir up controversy about it -- they obviously are apprehensive in terms of the message getting out there and those people are gonna get thumped because this is a good message.

Absolutely. In some of these districts, absolutely, and there's nothing wrong with that. Who can argue against the people's movement. It's like who can argue against it in America's past history, the movements that changed our views on civil rights and respect for equality in other arenas. This is what the tea party movement is all about too. Respecting our Constitution and not usurping the power of the people. All political power is supposed to be inherent in the people. Who can argue this movement?

I would be willing to if I believe that it's right for the country. Today I see many, many other men and women across our country who are in as strong or stronger position than I am to take on the White House and if they're in a better position than I in three years, I'll support them.

The whole qualification issue still perplexes me, because in the campaign we tried to bring attention to the fact that Obama had really not a lot of experience. And I do say that my executive experience, as an administrator, as a team manager if you will was, and so was John McCain's as a matter of fact, was stronger and we had more experience than Barack Obama did in terms of managing huge multi-billion dollar budgets and thousands of employees that I had just come from a position of that and that hasn't changed.

And without McCain, I mean Barack Obama had 150 days in the U.S. Senate where he was able to vote quite often present, not have to make decisions, being one of many, not having to manage. His executive position now in the White House is as, whether he likes it or not, a manager. He has to make tough decisions. He has to be willing to fire people, though you don't make any friends when you fire people and I know that first hand because I've had to do that. And you have to make tough decisions, and not dither on issues. You have to make quick decisions in many respects and I think that President Obama with all due respect, his lack of experience is really made manifest in the way that decisions are made in the White House today.

I sure wish that the present tool being used to reform health care would die, but I don't trust as far as I can throw them some of the people who are saying ok, we'll slow down, we hear from ya' -- people, we're not gonna try to take over one-sixth of the economy. I don't trust these, some of these people, that it is dead. It should be dead, the tool that's being put together right now for health care reform. We need to just get back to, scrap this thing, look at common sense steps that can reform health care like the tort reform and purchasing insurance across state lines and allowing employers and employees to receive the same tax benefits when you purchase insurance, those common sense steps that have broad support. That's what we should be looking at, not big old government with a trillion-dollar plus price tag, we're gonna take it over and we're gonna run it better than the private sector can, so in that respect what they're working on today there in Congress and the White House, it needs to die. 

 Thank you, Iowa. Thank you so much. The sign that says,  Thank you, Sarah,  no, I thank you. You are what keeps me going, keeps so many of us going. Your love of country keeps us going. Thank you so much. Iowa, you are good people. You are all good people who are here. Thank you.

It is an honor to be in the Heartland sharing this Labor Day weekend with you. And I thank you so much for the invitation, to these organizers who put so much work into all this. It‚Äôs so good to see the O4P and C4P people here today. Last night was fun ‚Äì getting to run into some of you at that restaurant and to see so many different demographics represented and so many different states all across our great nation. We got to gather together last night ‚Äì different demographics, different political parties even represented ‚Äì and Todd reminded me as we walked out of that room, he said,  See, we‚Äôre not celebrating ‚Äòred America‚Äô or ‚Äòblue America.‚Äô We‚Äôre celebrating red, white, and blue America. 

So, what brought us here today out in this field? Why aren‚Äôt we catching a Cyclones game, or watching the Hawkeyes perhaps, or grilling up some venison and corn-on-the-cob, maybe some caribou with some friends on this Labor Day weekend? What brought us together is a love of country. And we see that America is hurting. We‚Äôre not willing to just sit back and watch her demise through some  fundamental transformation  of the greatest country on earth. We‚Äôre here to stop that transformation and to begin the restoration of the country that we love.

We‚Äôre here because America is at a tipping point. America faces a crisis. And it‚Äôs not a crisis like perhaps a Midwest summer storm ‚Äì the kind that moves in and hits hard, but then it moves on.  No, this kind will relentlessly rage until we do restore all that is free and good and right about America. It‚Äôs not just fear of a double dip recession. And it‚Äôs not even the shame of a credit downgrade for the first time in U.S. history. It‚Äôs deeper than that. This is a systemic crisis due to failed policies and incompetent leadership. And we‚Äôre going to speak truth today. It may be hard-hitting, but we‚Äôre going to speak truth today because we need to start talking about what hasn‚Äôt worked, and we‚Äôre going to start talking about what will work for America. We will talk truth.

Now, some of us saw this day coming. It was three years ago on this very day that I spoke at the GOP Convention where I was honored to be able to accept the nomination for vice president that night. And in my speech I asked America:  When the cloud of rhetoric has passed, when the roar of the crowd fades away‚Ä¶.what exactly is [Barack Obama‚Äôs] plan? What does he actually seek to accomplish after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet? The answer is to make government bigger, and take more of your money, and give you more orders from Washington, and to reduce the strength of America in a dangerous world.  I spoke of this, but back then it was only my words that you had to go by. Now you have seen the proof yourself. Candidate Obama didn‚Äôt have a record while he was in office, but President Obama sure does, and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here today.

Candidate Obama pledged to fundamentally transform America. And for all the failures and the broken promises, that‚Äôs the one thing he has delivered on. We‚Äôve transformed from a country of hope to one of anxiety. Today, one in five working-age men are out of work. One in seven Americans are on food stamps. Thirty percent of our mortgages are underwater. In parts of Michigan and California, they‚Äôre suffering from unemployment numbers that are greater than during the depths of the Great Depression. Barack Obama promised to cut the deficit in half, and instead he turned around and he tripled it. And now our national debt is growing at $3 million a minute. That‚Äôs $4.25 billion a day.

President Obama, is this what you call  winning the future ? I call it losing ‚Äì losing our country and with it the American dream. President Obama, these people ‚Äì these Americans ‚Äì feel that  fierce urgency of now.  But do you feel it, sir?

The Tea Party was borne of this urgency. It‚Äôs the same sense of urgency that propelled the Sons of Liberty during the Revolution. It‚Äôs the same sense of urgency that propelled the Abolitionists before the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement during the 20th Century. The Tea Party Movement is part of this noble American tradition. This movement isn‚Äôt simply a political awakening; it‚Äôs an American awakening. And it‚Äôs coming from ordinary Americans, not the politicos in the Beltway. No, it‚Äôs you who grow our food; you run our small businesses; you teach our children; you fight our wars. We are always proud of America. We love our country in good times and in bad, and we never apologize for America.

That is why the far left‚Äôs irresponsible and radical policies awakened a sleeping America so that we finally understood what it was that we were about to lose. We were about to lose the blessings of liberty and prosperity. So, the working men and women of this country, you got up off your couch, you came down from the deer stand, you came out of the duck blind, you got off the John Deere, and we took to the streets, and we took to the town halls, and we ended up at the ballot box. And as much as the media wants you to forget this, Tea Party Americans won an electoral victory of historic proportions in November. We the people, we rose up and we rejected the left‚Äôs big government agenda. We don‚Äôt want it. We can‚Äôt afford it. And we are unwilling to pay for it.

That victory, remember friends, was only one step in a long march towards saving our country.

We sent a new class of leaders to D.C., but immediately the permanent political class tried to co-opt them ‚Äì because the reality is we are governed by a permanent political class, until we change that. They talk endlessly about cutting government spending, and yet they keep spending more. They talk about massive unsustainable debt, and yet they keep incurring more. They spend, they print, they borrow, they spend more, and then they stick us with the bill. Then they pat their own backs, and they claim that they faced and  solved  the debt crisis that they got us in, but when we were humiliated in front of the world with our country‚Äôs first credit downgrade, they promptly went on vacation.

No, they don‚Äôt feel the same urgency that we do. But why should they? For them business is good; business is very good.  Seven of the ten wealthiest counties are suburbs of Washington, D.C. Polls there actually ‚Äì and usually I say polls, eh, they‚Äôre for strippers and cross country skiers ‚Äì but polls in those parts show that some people there believe that the economy has actually improved. See, there may not be a recession in Georgetown, but there is in the rest of America.

Yeah, the permanent political class ‚Äì they‚Äôre doing just fine. Ever notice how so many of them arrive in Washington, D.C. of modest means and then miraculously throughout the years they end up becoming very, very wealthy? Well, it‚Äôs because they derive power and their wealth from their access to our money ‚Äì to taxpayer dollars.  They use it to bail out their friends on Wall Street and their corporate cronies, and to reward campaign contributors, and to buy votes via earmarks. There is so much waste. And there is a name for this: It‚Äôs called corporate crony capitalism. This is not the capitalism of free men and free markets, of innovation and hard work and ethics, of sacrifice and of risk. No, this is the capitalism of connections and government bailouts and handouts, of waste and influence peddling and corporate welfare. This is the crony capitalism that destroyed Europe‚Äôs economies. It‚Äôs the collusion of big government and big business and big finance to the detriment of all the rest ‚Äì to the little guys. It‚Äôs a slap in the face to our small business owners ‚Äì the true entrepreneurs, the job creators accounting for 70% of the jobs in America, it‚Äôs you who own these small businesses, you‚Äôre the economic engine, but you don‚Äôt grease the wheels of government power.

So, do you want to know why the permanent political class doesn‚Äôt really want to cut any spending? Do you want to know why nothing ever really gets done? It‚Äôs because there‚Äôs nothing in it for them. They‚Äôve got a lot of mouths to feed ‚Äì a lot of corporate lobbyists and a lot of special interests that are counting on them to keep the good times and the money rolling along.

It doesn‚Äôt surprise me. I‚Äôve seen this kind of crony capitalism before. It‚Äôs is the same good old boy politics-as-usual that I fought and we defeated in my home state. I took on a corrupt and compromised political class and their backroom dealings with Big Oil. And I can tell you from experience that sudden and relentless reform never sits well with entrenched interests and power-brokers. So, please you must vet a candidate‚Äôs record. You must know their ability to successfully reform and actually fix problems that they‚Äôre going to claim that they inherited.

Real reform never sits well with the entrenched special interests, and that‚Äôs why the true voices of reform are so quickly demonized. Look what they say about you. You are concerned civilized citizens and look what they say about you. And just look what happened during the debt-ceiling debate. We‚Äôd been given warning after warning that our credit rating would be downgraded if politicians didn‚Äôt get serious about tackling the debt and deficit problem. But instead of making the real cuts that are necessary, they used Enron-like accounting gimmicks, and they promised that if they were just allowed to spend trillions more today, they‚Äôd cut billions ten years from now. By some magical thinking, they figured they could run up trillion dollar deficits year after year, yet still somehow avoid the unforgiving mathematics that led to the downgrade. Well, they got a rude awakening from the rest of the world, and that‚Äôs that even America isn‚Äôt  too big to fail. 

When we finally did get slapped with that inevitable downgraded, the politicians and the pundits turned around and blamed us ‚Äì independent commonsense conservatives. We got blamed! They called us un-American and terrorists and suicide bombers and‚Ä¶hobbits‚Ä¶couldn‚Äôt understand that one.

And what is the President‚Äôs answer to this enormous debt problem? It‚Äôs just spend more money. Only you can‚Äôt call it  spending  now. Now you got to call it  investing.  Don‚Äôt call it  spending.  Call it  investing.  It‚Äôs kind of like what happens with FEMA and some of these other bureaucratic agencies that don‚Äôt really want to refer to our centralized federal government as  government.  Now it‚Äôs called the  federal family.  Am I too old to ask to be emancipated? Never thought I‚Äôd say it, but I want a divorce.

No, the President‚Äôs answer to our debt problem is: Incur more debt. Spend more money (only call it  investing ). Make more folks even more reliant on government to supply their every need. This is the antithesis of the pioneering American spirit that empowered the individual to work, to produce, to be able to thrive and succeed with fulfillment and with pride; and that in turn built our free and hope-filled and proud country.

He wants to  Win The Future  by  investing  more of your hard-earned money in some harebrained ideas like more solar panels and really fast trains. These are things that venture capitalists will tell you are non-starters, yet he wants to do more of them. We‚Äôre flat broke, but he thinks these solar panels and really fast trains are going to magically save us. He‚Äôs shouting  all aboard Obama‚Äôs bullet train to bankruptcy.   

The only future that Barack Obama is trying to win is his own re-election, and he has shown that he‚Äôs perfectly willing to mortgage our children‚Äôs future to pay for it. And there is proof of this. Just look closely at where all that  green energy  stimulus money is  invested.  See a pattern. The President‚Äôs big campaign donors got nice returns for their  investments  in him to the tune of billions of your tax dollars in the form of  green energy  stimulus funds. The technical term for this is  pay-to-play.  Between bailouts for Wall Street cronies and stimulus projects for union bosses‚Äô security and  green energy  giveaways, he took care of his friends. And now they‚Äôre on course to raise a billion dollars for his re-election bid so that they can do it all over again. Are you going to let them do it all over again? Are you willing to unite to do all we can to not let them do it again so we can save our country?

Now to be fair, some GOP candidates also raised mammoth amounts of cash, and we need to ask them, too: What, if anything, do their donors expect in return for their  investments ? We need to know this because our country can‚Äôt afford more trillion-dollar  thank you  notes to campaign backers. It is an important question, and it cuts to the heart of our problem. And I speak from experience in confronting the corruption and the crony capitalism since starting out in public office 20 years ago. I‚Äôve been out-spent in my campaigns two to one, three to one, five to one. (And, by the way, I don‚Äôt play that game either of hiring expert political advisors just so they‚Äôll say something nice about me on TV ‚Äì if you ever wonder. You know how that game‚Äôs played too I‚Äôm sure.) But the reason is simple: It‚Äôs because like you, I‚Äôm not for sale. It‚Äôs because we believe in the free market. I believe in the free market, and that is why I detest crony capitalism. And Barack Obama has shown us cronyism on steroids. It will lead to our downfall if we don‚Äôt stop it now. It‚Äôs a root that grows our economic problems. Our unsustainable debt and our high unemployment numbers and a housing market that‚Äôs in the tank and a stagnant economy ‚Äì these are all symptoms. Politicians are so focused on the symptoms and not the disease. We will not solve our economic problems until we confront the cronyism of our President and our permanent political class.

So, this is why we must remember that the challenge is not simply to replace Obama in 2012. The real challenge is who and what we will replace him with. It‚Äôs not enough to just change up the uniform. If we don‚Äôt change the team and the game plan, we won‚Äôt save our country.

Yes, we need sudden and relentless reform, and that will return power to  We the People.  This, of course, requires deeds, not just words. It‚Äôs not good enough for politicians to just be throwing our way some vague generalities, talking about some promises here and there. It‚Äôs time that we hold them accountable. It is amazing to me that even some good conservatives run away from being honest and straight up with us about what needs to be done. They don‚Äôt want to rock the boat. They can‚Äôt hurt future election prospects evidently. They just talk vaguely about cuts and then they move on. They‚Äôre too busy saying what they think we want to hear, but instead they should be telling us what needs to be said and what needs to be done. So, let us today in this field have that adult conversation about what needs to be done to restore America. Let‚Äôs do that now.

In five days time, our President will gift us with yet another speech. In his next speech he‚Äôll reveal his latest new super-duper  jobs plan.  It will have more lofty goals and flowery rhetoric, more illogical economic fantasies and more continued blame and finger-pointing. But listen closely to what he says. All of his  solutions  will revolve around more of the same ‚Äì more payoffs for his friends and supporters. His  plan  is the same as it‚Äôs always been, and that‚Äôs grow more government, increase more debt, take and give more of your hard-earned money to special interests. And this is such a problem. But you know what the problems are. We could go on all day about the problems caused by the status quo in Washington. Status quo I think is Latin for  more of the same mess that we‚Äôre in.  That status quo won‚Äôt work any more. We could go on all day about the problems, but you know them because you live them everyday. So, let‚Äôs talk about real solutions. I want to tell you what my plan is. My plan is a bona-fide pro-working man‚Äôs plan, and it deals in reality. It deals in the way that the world really works because we must talk about what really works in order to get America back to work.

My plan is about empowerment: empowerment of our states, empowerment of our entrepreneurs, most importantly empowerment of you ‚Äì our hardworking individuals ‚Äì because I have faith, I have trust, I have respect for you.

The way forward is no more politics as usual. We must stop expanding an out-of-control and out-of-touch federal government. This is first: All power not specifically delegated to the federal government by our Constitution is reserved for the states and for we the people. So, let‚Äôs enforce the 10th Amendment and devolve powers back locally where the Founders intended them to be.

Second, what happened to all those promises about staying committed to repealing the mother of all big government unfunded mandates? We must repeal Obamacare! And rein in burdensome regulations that are a boot on our neck. Get government out of the way. Let the private sector breathe and grow. This will allow the confidence that businesses need in order to expand and hire more people.

Third, no more run away debt. We must prioritize and cut. Cancel unused stimulus funds, and have that come to Jesus moment where we own up to the debt challenge that is entitlement reform. See, the reality is we will have entitlement reform; it‚Äôs just a matter of how we‚Äôre going to get there. We either do it ourselves or the world‚Äôs capital markets are going to shove it down our throats, and we‚Äôll have no choice but to reform our entitlement programs. The status quo is no longer an option. Entitlement reform is our duty now, and it must be done in a way that honors our commitment to our esteemed elders today, while keeping faith with future generations. I don‚Äôt think anything has irked me more than this nonsense coming from the White House about maybe not sending our seniors their checks. It‚Äôs their money! They have paid into Social Security all of their working lives; and for the President to say,  ah, we may not be able to cut their checks,  ah, well, where did all their money go, politicians? It‚Äôs like the Commander-in-Chief being willing to throw our military under the bus by threatening that their paychecks may not arrive. But the politicians will still get their checks and their secure retirements, and he‚Äôll still get his posh vacations. Aren‚Äôt you just sick to death of those skewed priorities? It‚Äôs all backwards. Our seniors and our brave men and women in uniform being used as pawns ‚Äì I say it‚Äôs shameful, and enough is enough. No more.

Fourth, it is time for America to become the energy superpower. The real stimulus that we‚Äôve been waiting for is robust and responsible domestic energy production. We have the resources. Affordable and secure energy is the key to any thriving economy, and it must be our foundation. So, I would do the opposite of Obama‚Äôs manipulation of U.S. supplies of energy. Drill here, drill now. Let the refineries and the pipelines be built. Stop kowtowing to foreign countries and dictators asking them to ramp up production and industry for us, promising them that we‚Äôll be their greatest customer. No, not when we have the resources here. We need to move on tapping our own God-given natural resources. I promise you that this will bring real job growth, not the politicians‚Äô phony  green jobs  fairy dust sprinkled with wishes and glitter‚Ä¶ No, a hardcore all-of-the-above energy policy that builds this indestructible link between made-in-America energy and our prosperity and our security. You know, there are enough large conventional natural resource development projects waiting for government approval that could potentially create more than a million high-paying jobs all across the country. And this is true stimulus. It wouldn‚Äôt cost government a dime to allow the private sector to do these. In fact, these projects will generate billions of dollars in revenue. Can you imagine that: a stimulus project that actually helps dig us out of debt instead of digging us further into it! And these are good-paying jobs, and I know that from experience. For years my own family was supported (as Todd worked up on the North Slope) by a good energy sector job. America‚Äôs economic revival starts with America‚Äôs energy revival.

Fifth, we can and we will make America the most attractive country on earth to do business in. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to do this. Right now, we have the highest federal corporate income tax rate in the industrialized world. Did you know our rates are higher than China and communist Cuba? This doesn‚Äôt generate as much revenue as you would think, though, because many big corporations skirt federal taxes because they have the friends in D.C. who right the rules for the rest of us. This makes us less competitive and restrains our engine of prosperity. Heck, some businesses spend more time trying to figure out how to hide their profits than they do in generating more profits so that they can expand and hire more of us. So, to make America the most attractive and competitive place to do business, to set up shop here and hire people here, to attract capital from all over the globe that will lead to an explosion of growth, instead of chasing industry offshore, I propose to eliminate all federal corporate income tax. And hear me out on this. This is how we create millions of high-paying jobs. This is how we increase opportunity and prosperity for all.

But here‚Äôs the best part: To balance out any loss of federal revenue from this tax cut, we eliminate corporate welfare and all the loopholes and we eliminate bailouts. This is how we break the back of crony capitalism because it feeds off corporate welfare, which is just socialism for the very rich. We can change all of that. The message then to job-creating corporations is: We‚Äôll unshackle you from the world‚Äôs highest federal corporate income tax rate, but you will stand or fall on your own, just like all the rest of us out on main street.

See, when we empower the job-creators, our economy will soar; Americans will get back to work.

This plan is a first step in a long march towards fundamental restoration of a strong and free market economy. And it represents the kind of real reform that we need. And, folks, it must come from you. It must come from the American people. Real hope is in you. It‚Äôs not that hopey-changey  stuff  that we heard about back in 2008. We‚Äôve all learned that. And real hope isn‚Äôt in an individual. It‚Äôs not in a politician certainly. And that hopey-changey stuff that was put in an individual back when Barack Obama was a candidate ‚Äì that hopey-changey stuff didn‚Äôt create one job in August, did it? That‚Äôs the first time that‚Äôs happened in the United States since World War II. Real hope comes from you. Real hope comes from realizing that we the people can make the difference. And you don‚Äôt need a title to make a difference. We can get this country back on the right track. We can do it by empowering the people and realizing that God has richly blessed this most exceptional nation, and then we do something about that realization.

Don‚Äôt wait for the permanent political class to reform anything for you. They won‚Äôt. They can‚Äôt. They can‚Äôt even take responsibility for their own actions. Our credit is downgraded, but it‚Äôs not their fault. Our economy‚Äôs in turmoil, but it‚Äôs not his fault. It‚Äôs the tsunami in Japan or the Middle East uprising. It‚Äôs Irene. It‚Äôs those doggone ATM machines.

Folks, the truth is Barack Obama is adrift with no plan because his  fundamental transformation  is at odds with everything that made this country great. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. He doesn‚Äôt make sense. Unbelievably our President declares that he  believes in American Exceptionalism‚Ä¶ just as the Greeks believe in Greek Exceptionalism.  Well, the path he has us on will make us just as  exceptional  as Greece, alright ‚Äì with the debt crisis and the stagnation and the unemployment and uprisings and all. 

Friends, you are better than that. Our country is better than that. We‚Äôve got to unite. We‚Äôve got to stand together. We can confront the problem and we can achieve lasting reform. And I can tell you from hard-earned experience with bumps and bruises along the way, that the road ahead is not easy. You will be demonized. They‚Äôll mock you. They‚Äôll make things up. They‚Äôll tell you to  go to hell.  But we‚Äôll bite our tongue, we‚Äôll keep it classy, and we won‚Äôt respond‚Äîas tempting as it is‚Äîto anyone who just has such disdain for our free market economy and for individual initiative and responsibility. We won‚Äôt say,  No, you go to hell.  No, we won‚Äôt say that. You know why we don‚Äôt have to say that? Because when we have time-tested truth and logic on our side, we win. And when we refuse to retreat because we know that our children‚Äôs future is at stake, we win.

No, the road isn‚Äôt easy, but it‚Äôs nothing compared to the suffering and sacrifice of those who came before us.

A few weeks ago, after my visit to the Iowa State Fair, I took my daughter Piper and my niece McKinley with us to the World War I Liberty Memorial in Kansas City. And standing in the rain, reading the inscriptions on the Memorial about the honor in one‚Äôs dedication to God and country, I thought of all those young patriots who suffered and died so far from home. And revering our vets there with the next generation by my side, there was such clarity ‚Äì clarity in our calling, patriotic Constitutionalists. We have a duty not just to the living, but also to those who came and died before us and to the generations yet to be born. Our freedom was purchased by millions of men now long-forgotten throughout history who charged the bayonets, and they charged the cannons; they knew they were going to die, but it was worth it for them sacrificing for future generations‚Äô freedom. They‚Äôre the ones who prayed in the trenches and suffered in the P.O.W. camps. They gave their lives so that we could be here today.

You and I are blessed to be  born the heirs of freedom.  As President John F. Kennedy said,  We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.  We are the heirs of those who froze with Washington at Valley Forge and who held the line at Gettysburg, who freed the slaves to close a shameful chapter, and who carved a nation out of the wilderness. We are the sons and daughters of those who stormed the beaches of Normandy and raised the flag at Iwo Jima and made America the strongest, the most prosperous, the greatest nation on earth forever in mankind‚Äôs history ‚Äì the greatest, most exceptional nation.

America, we will always endure. We will always come through. We will never give up. We shall endure because we live by that moral strength that we call grace. Because though we‚Äôve often skirted a precipice, a Providential Hand has always guided us to a better future. So, let us seek that Hand once more. Our Ronald Reagan said,  If we ever forget that we are one nation under God, we will be a nation gone under.  Yes, He shed his grace on thee, America! We will not squander what we have been given! We will fight for freedom. We will fight for America. We are at the tipping point. United we must stand. And we shall nobly save, not meanly lose, this last best hope on earth.

So, God bless you, Iowa! God bless the United States of America!

Thank you, Gwen. And I thank the commission, also. I appreciate this privilege of being able to be here and speak with Americans.

You know, I think a good barometer here, as we try to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time in America's economy, is go to a kid's soccer game on Saturday, and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them,  How are you feeling about the economy? 

And I'll bet you, you're going to hear some fear in that parent's voice, fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market. Did we just take a major hit with those investments?

Fear about, how are we going to afford to send our kids to college? A fear, as small-business owners, perhaps, how we're going to borrow any money to increase inventory or hire more people.

The barometer there, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform to that end.

Now, John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform. Two years ago, remember, it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures. He sounded that warning bell.

People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didn't want to listen to him and wouldn't go towards that reform that was needed then. I think that the alarm has been heard, though, and there will be that greater oversight, again thanks to John McCain's bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks together over this past week, even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive politics aside and putting the country first.


John McCain, in referring to the fundamental of our economy being strong, he was talking to and he was talking about the American workforce. And the American workforce is the greatest in this world, with the ingenuity and the work ethic that is just entrenched in our workforce.

That's a positive. That's encouragement. And that's what John McCain meant.

Now, what I've done as a governor and as a mayor is (inaudible) I've had that track record of reform. And I've joined this team that is a team of mavericks with John McCain, also, with his track record of reform, where we're known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done.

Now, Barack Obama, of course, he's pretty much only voted along his party lines. In fact, 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line, not having that proof for the American people to know that his commitment, too, is, you know, put the partisanship, put the special interests aside, and get down to getting business done for the people of America.

We're tired of the old politics as usual. And that's why, with all due respect, I do respect your years in the U.S. Senate, but I think Americans are craving something new and different and that new energy and that new commitment that's going to come with reform.

I think that's why we need to send the maverick from the Senate and put him in the White House, and I'm happy to join him there.

Darn right it was the predator lenders, who tried to talk Americans into thinking that it was smart to buy a $300,000 house if we could only afford a $100,000 house. There was deception there, and there was greed and there is corruption on Wall Street. And we need to stop that.

Again, John McCain and I, that commitment that we have made, and we're going to follow through on that, getting rid of that corruption.

One thing that Americans do at this time, also, though, is let's commit ourselves just every day American people, Joe Six Pack, hockey moms across the nation, I think we need to band together and say never again. Never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those who are managing our money and loaning us these dollars. We need to make sure that we demand from the federal government strict oversight of those entities in charge of our investments and our savings and we need also to not get ourselves in debt. Let's do what our parents told us before we probably even got that first credit card. Don't live outside of our means. We need to make sure that as individuals we're taking personal responsibility through all of this. It's not the American peoples fault that the economy is hurting like it is, but we have an opportunity to learn a heck of a lot of good lessons through this and say never again will we be taken advantage of.

I would like to respond about the tax increases. We can speak in agreement here that darn right we need tax relief for Americans so that jobs can be created here. Now, Barack Obama and Sen. Biden also voted for the largest tax increases in U.S. history. Barack had 94 opportunities to side on the people's side and reduce taxes and 94 times he voted to increase taxes or not support a tax reduction, 94 times.

Now, that's not what we need to create jobs and really bolster and heat up our economy. We do need the private sector to be able to keep more of what we earn and produce. Government is going to have to learn to be more efficient and live with less if that's what it takes to reign in the government growth that we've seen today. But we do need tax relief and Barack Obama even supported increasing taxes as late as last year for those families making only $42,000 a year. That's a lot of middle income average American families to increase taxes on them. I think that is the way to kill jobs and to continue to harm our economy.

I'm still on the tax thing because I want to correct you on that again. And I want to let you know what I did as a mayor and as a governor. And I may not answer the questions that either the moderator or you want to hear, but I'm going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also. As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes. I eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax. We did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up. Now, as for John McCain's adherence to rules and regulations and pushing for even harder and tougher regulations, that is another thing that he is known for though. Look at the tobacco industry. Look at campaign finance reform.

IFILL: OK, our time is up here. We've got to move to the next question. Sen. Biden, we want to talk about taxes, let's talk about taxes. You proposed raising taxes on people who earn over $250,000 a year. The question for you is, why is that not class warfare and the same question for you, Gov. Palin, is you have proposed a tax employer health benefits which some studies say would actually throw five million more people onto the roles of the uninsured. I want to know why that isn't taking things out on the poor, starting with you, Sen. Biden.

I do take issue with some of the principle there with that redistribution of wealth principle that seems to be espoused by you. But when you talk about Barack's plan to tax increase affecting only those making $250,000 a year or more, you're forgetting millions of small businesses that are going to fit into that category. So they're going to be the ones paying higher taxes thus resulting in fewer jobs being created and less productivity.

Now you said recently that higher taxes or asking for higher taxes or paying higher taxes is patriotic. In the middle class of America which is where Todd and I have been all of our lives, that's not patriotic. Patriotic is saying, government, you know, you're not always the solution. In fact, too often you're the problem so, government, lessen the tax burden and on our families and get out of the way and let the private sector and our families grow and thrive and prosper. An increased tax formula that Barack Obama is proposing in addition to nearly a trillion dollars in new spending that he's proposing is the backwards way of trying to grow our economy.
I am because he's got a good health care plan that is detailed. And I want to give you a couple details on that. He's proposing a $5,000 tax credit for families so that they can get out there and they can purchase their own health care coverage. That's a smart thing to do. That's budget neutral. That doesn't cost the government anything as opposed to Barack Obama's plan to mandate health care coverage and have universal government run program and unless you're pleased with the way the federal government has been running anything lately, I don't think that it's going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the feds. But a $5,000 health care credit through our income tax that's budget neutral. That's going to help. And he also wants to erase those artificial lines between states so that through competition, we can cross state lines and if there's a better plan offered somewhere else, we would be able to purchase that. So affordability and accessibility will be the keys there with that $5,000 tax credit also being offered.

Now... I want to get -- try to get you both to answer a question that neither of your principals quite answered when my colleague, Jim Lehrer, asked it last week, starting with you, Sen. Biden.

What promises -- given the events of the week, the bailout plan, all of this, what promises have you and your campaigns made to the American people that you're not going to be able to keep?

Well, the nice thing about running with John McCain is I can assure you he doesn't tell one thing to one group and then turns around and tells something else to another group, including his plans that will make this bailout plan, this rescue plan, even better.

I want to go back to the energy plan, though, because this is -- this is an important one that Barack Obama, he voted for in '05.

Sen. Biden, you would remember that, in that energy plan that Obama voted for, that's what gave those oil companies those big tax breaks. Your running mate voted for that.

You know what I had to do in the state of Alaska? I had to take on those oil companies and tell them,  No,  you know, any of the greed there that has been kind of instrumental, I guess, in their mode of operation, that wasn't going to happen in my state.

And that's why Tillerson at Exxon and Mulva at ConocoPhillips, bless their hearts, they're doing what they need to do, as corporate CEOs, but they're not my biggest fans, because what I had to do up there in Alaska was to break up a monopoly up there and say, you know, the people are going to come first and we're going to make sure that we have value given to the people of Alaska with those resources.

And those huge tax breaks aren't coming to the big multinational corporations anymore, not when it adversely affects the people who live in a state and, in this case, in a country who should be benefiting at the same time.

So it was Barack Obama who voted for that energy plan that gave those tax breaks to the oil companies that I then had to turn around, as a governor of an energy-producing state, and kind of undo in my own area of expertise, and that's energy.

There is not. And how long have I been at this, like five weeks? So there hasn't been a whole lot that I've promised, except to do what is right for the American people, put government back on the side of the American people, stop the greed and corruption on Wall Street.

And the rescue plan has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and deserving. And I don't believe that John McCain has made any promise that he would not be able to keep, either.

Yes, I would have. But here, again, there have -- there have been so many changes in the conditions of our economy in just even these past weeks that there has been more and more revelation made aware now to Americans about the corruption and the greed on Wall Street.

We need to look back, even two years ago, and we need to be appreciative of John McCain's call for reform with Fannie Mae, with Freddie Mac, with the mortgage-lenders, too, who were starting to really kind of rear that head of abuse.

And the colleagues in the Senate weren't going to go there with him. So we have John McCain to thank for at least warning people. And we also have John McCain to thank for bringing in a bipartisan effort people to the table so that we can start putting politics aside, even putting a campaign aside, and just do what's right to fix this economic problem that we are in.

It is a crisis. It's a toxic mess, really, on Main Street that's affecting Wall Street. And now we have to be ever vigilant and also making sure that credit markets don't seize up. That's where the Main Streeters like me, that's where we would really feel the effects.

That is not so, but because that's just a quick answer, I want to talk about, again, my record on energy versus your ticket's energy ticket, also.

I think that this is important to come back to, with that energy policy plan again that was voted for in '05.

When we talk about energy, we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent.

It's a nonsensical position that we are in when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land. And East Coast politicians who don't allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, to tap into them, and instead we're relying on foreign countries to produce for us.

We're circulating about $700 billion a year into foreign countries, some who do not like America -- they certainly don't have our best interests at heart -- instead of those dollars circulating here, creating tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of energy to be tapped into and start flowing into these very, very hungry markets.

Energy independence is the key to this nation's future, to our economic future, and to our national security. So when we talk about energy plans, it's not just about who got a tax break and who didn't. And we're not giving oil companies tax breaks, but it's about a heck of a lot more than that.

Energy independence is the key to America's future.

Yes. Well, as the nation's only Arctic state and being the governor of that state, Alaska feels and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state. And we know that it's real.

I'm not one to attribute every man -- activity of man to the changes in the climate. There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet.

But there are real changes going on in our climate. And I don't want to argue about the causes. What I want to argue about is, how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts?

We have got to clean up this planet. We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change, what we can do about that.

As governor, I was the first governor to form a climate change sub-cabinet to start dealing with the impacts. We've got to reduce emissions. John McCain is right there with an  all of the above  approach to deal with climate change impacts.

We've got to become energy independent for that reason. Also as we rely more and more on other countries that don't care as much about the climate as we do, we're allowing them to produce and to emit and even pollute more than America would ever stand for.

So even in dealing with climate change, it's all the more reason that we have an  all of the above  approach, tapping into alternative sources of energy and conserving fuel, conserving our petroleum products and our hydrocarbons so that we can clean up this planet and deal with climate change.

Yes, Sen. McCain does support this. The chant is  drill, baby, drill.  And that's what we hear all across this country in our rallies because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into.

They know that even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas. And we're building a nearly $40 billion natural gas pipeline which is North America's largest and most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets.

Barack Obama and Sen. Biden, you've said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that we're in. You even called drilling -- safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf.

There -- with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that. But also in that  all of the above  approach that Sen. McCain supports, the alternative fuels will be tapped into: the nuclear, the clean coal.

I was surprised to hear you mention that because you had said that there isn't anything -- such a thing as clean coal. And I think you said it in a rope line, too, at one of your rallies.

Well, not if it goes closer and closer towards redefining the traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman. And unfortunately that's sometimes where those steps lead.

But I also want to clarify, if there's any kind of suggestion at all from my answer that I would be anything but tolerant of adults in America choosing their partners, choosing relationships that they deem best for themselves, you know, I am tolerant and I have a very diverse family and group of friends and even within that group you would see some who may not agree with me on this issue, some very dear friends who don't agree with me on this issue.

But in that tolerance also, no one would ever propose, not in a McCain-Palin administration, to do anything to prohibit, say, visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed, negotiated between parties.

But I will tell Americans straight up that I don't support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman, and I think through nuances we can go round and round about what that actually means.

But I'm being as straight up with Americans as I can in my non- support for anything but a traditional definition of marriage.

Your question to him was whether he supported gay marriage and my answer is the same as his and it is that I do not.

I am very thankful that we do have a good plan and the surge and the counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq that has proven to work, I am thankful that that is part of the plan implemented under a great American hero, Gen. Petraeus, and pushed hard by another great American, Sen. John McCain.

I know that the other ticket opposed this surge, in fact, even opposed funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so.

PALIN: And Sen. Biden, I respected you when you called him out on that. You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives. And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that. He turned around under political pressure and he voted against funding the troops. We do have a plan for withdrawal. We don't need early withdrawal out of Iraq. We cannot afford to lose there or we're going to be no better off in the war in Afghanistan either. We have got to win in Iraq.

And with the surge that has worked we're now down to pre-surge numbers in Iraq. That's where we can be. We can start putting more troops in Afghanistan as we also work with our NATO allies who are there strengthening us and we need to grow our military. We cannot afford to lose against al Qaeda and the Shia extremists who are still there, still fighting us, but we're getting closer and closer to victory. And it would be a travesty if we quit now in Iraq.

Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq and that is not what our troops need to hear today, that's for sure. And it's not what our nation needs to be able to count on. You guys opposed the surge. The surge worked. Barack Obama still can't admit the surge works.

We'll know when we're finished in Iraq when the Iraqi government can govern its people and when the Iraqi security forces can secure its people. And our commanders on the ground will tell us when those conditions have been met. And Maliki and Talabani also in working with us are knowing again that we are getting closer and closer to that point, that victory that's within sight.

Now, you said regarding Sen. McCain's military policies there, Sen. Biden, that you supported a lot of these things. In fact, you said in fact that you wanted to run, you'd be honored to run with him on the ticket. That's an indication I think of some of the support that you had at least until you became the VP pick here.

You also said that Barack Obama was not ready to be commander in chief. And I know again that you opposed the move he made to try to cut off funding for the troops and I respect you for that. I don't know how you can defend that position now but I know that you know especially with your son in the National Guard and I have great respect for your family also and the honor that you show our military. Barack Obama though, another story there. Anyone I think who can cut off funding for the troops after promising not to is another story.

Both are extremely dangerous, of course. And as for who coined that central war on terror being in Iraq, it was the Gen. Petraeus and al Qaeda, both leaders there and it's probably the only thing that they're ever going to agree on, but that it was a central war on terror is in Iraq. You don't have to believe me or John McCain on that. I would believe Petraeus and the leader of al Qaeda.

An armed, nuclear armed especially Iran is so extremely dangerous to consider. They cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons period. Israel is in jeopardy of course when we're dealing with Ahmadinejad as a leader of Iran. Iran claiming that Israel as he termed it, a stinking corpse, a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth. Now a leader like Ahmadinejad who is not sane or stable when he says things like that is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons. Ahmadinejad, Kim Jong Il, the Castro brothers, others who are dangerous dictators are one that Barack Obama has said he would be willing to meet with without preconditions being met first.

And an issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment. A statement that he made like that is downright dangerous because leaders like Ahmadinejad who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the earth an ally like we have in Israel should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first.

No and Dr. Henry Kissinger especially. I had a good conversation with him recently. And he shared with me his passion for diplomacy. And that's what John McCain and I would engage in also. But again, with some of these dictators who hate America and hate what we stand for, with our freedoms, our democracy, our tolerance, our respect for women's rights, those who would try to destroy what we stand for cannot be met with just sitting down on a presidential level as Barack Obama had said he would be willing to do. That is beyond bad judgment. That is dangerous.

No, diplomacy is very important. First and foremost, that is what we would engage in. But diplomacy is hard work by serious people. It's lining out clear objectives and having your friends and your allies ready to back you up there and have sanctions lined up before any kind of presidential summit would take place.

A two-state solution is the solution. And Secretary Rice, having recently met with leaders on one side or the other there, also, still in these waning days of the Bush administration, trying to forge that peace, and that needs to be done, and that will be top of an agenda item, also, under a McCain-Palin administration.

Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East. We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, that that is what they would like to see.

We will support Israel. A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish, with this peace-seeking nation, and they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements.

They succeeded with Jordan. They succeeded with Egypt. I'm sure that we're going to see more success there, also.

It's got to be a commitment of the United States of America, though. And I can promise you, in a McCain-Palin administration, that commitment is there to work with our friends in Israel.

No, I do not believe that it has been. But I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel, and I think that is a good thing to get to agree on, Sen. Biden. I respect your position on that.

No, in fact, when we talk about the Bush administration, there's a time, too, when Americans are going to say,  Enough is enough with your ticket,  on constantly looking backwards, and pointing fingers, and doing the blame game.

There have been huge blunders in the war. There have been huge blunders throughout this administration, as there are with every administration.

But for a ticket that wants to talk about change and looking into the future, there's just too much finger-pointing backwards to ever make us believe that that's where you're going.

Positive change is coming, though. Reform of government is coming. We'll learn from the past mistakes in this administration and other administrations.

And we're going to forge ahead with putting government back on the side of the people and making sure that our country comes first, putting obsessive partisanship aside.

That's what John McCain has been known for in all these years. He has been the maverick. He has ruffled feathers.

But I know, Sen. Biden, you have respected for them that, and I respect you for acknowledging that. But change is coming.


Nuclear weaponry, of course, would be the be all, end all of just too many people in too many parts of our planet, so those dangerous regimes, again, cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons, period.

Our nuclear weaponry here in the U.S. is used as a deterrent. And that's a safe, stable way to use nuclear weaponry.

But for those countries -- North Korea, also, under Kim Jong Il -- we have got to make sure that we're putting the economic sanctions on these countries and that we have friends and allies supporting us in this to make sure that leaders like Kim Jong Il and Ahmadinejad are not allowed to acquire, to proliferate, or to use those nuclear weapons. It is that important.

Can we talk about Afghanistan real quick, also, though?

OK, I'd like to just really quickly mention there, too, that when you look back and you say that the Bush administration's policy on Afghanistan perhaps would be the same as McCain, and that's not accurate.

The surge principles, not the exact strategy, but the surge principles that have worked in Iraq need to be implemented in Afghanistan, also. And that, perhaps, would be a difference with the Bush administration.

Now, Barack Obama had said that all we're doing in Afghanistan is air-raiding villages and killing civilians. And such a reckless, reckless comment and untrue comment, again, hurts our cause.

That's not what we're doing there. We're fighting terrorists, and we're securing democracy, and we're building schools for children there so that there is opportunity in that country, also. There will be a big difference there, and we will win in -- in Afghanistan, also.

Well, first, McClellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in Afghanistan. Certainly, accounting for different conditions in that different country and conditions are certainly different. We have NATO allies helping us for one and even the geographic differences are huge but the counterinsurgency principles could work in Afghanistan. McClellan didn't say anything opposite of that. The counterinsurgency strategy going into Afghanistan, clearing, holding, rebuilding, the civil society and the infrastructure can work in Afghanistan. And those leaders who are over there, who have also been advising George Bush on this have not said anything different but that.

Oh, yeah, it's so obvious I'm a Washington outsider. And someone just not used to the way you guys operate. Because here you voted for the war and now you oppose the war. You're one who says, as so many politicians do, I was for it before I was against it or vice- versa. Americans are craving that straight talk and just want to know, hey, if you voted for it, tell us why you voted for it and it was a war resolution.

And you had supported John McCain's military strategies pretty adamantly until this race and you had opposed very adamantly Barack Obama's military strategy, including cutting off funding for the troops that attempt all through the primary.

And I watched those debates, so I remember what those were all about.

But as for as Darfur, we can agree on that also, the supported of the no-fly zone, making sure that all options are on the table there also.

America is in a position to help. What I've done in my position to help, as the governor of a state that's pretty rich in natural resources, we have a $40 billion investment fund, a savings fund called the Alaska Permanent Fund.

When I and others in the legislature found out we had some millions of dollars in Sudan, we called for divestment through legislation of those dollars to make sure we weren't doing anything that would be seen as condoning the activities there in Darfur. That legislation hasn't passed yet but it needs to because all of us, as individuals, and as humanitarians and as elected officials should do all we can to end those atrocities in that region of the world.

I beg to disagree with you, again, here on whether you supported Barack Obama or John McCain's strategies. Here again, you can say what you want to say a month out before people are asked to vote on this, but we listened to the debates.

I think tomorrow morning, the pundits are going to start do the who said what at what time and we'll have proof of some of this, but, again, John McCain who knows how to win a war. Who's been there and he's faced challenges and he knows what evil is and knows what it takes to overcome the challenges here with our military.

He knows to learn from the mistakes and blunders we have seen in the war in Iraq, especially. He will know how to implement the strategies, working with our commanders and listening to what they have to say, taking the politics out of these war issues. He'll know how to win a war.

And heaven forbid, yes, that would ever happen, no matter how this ends up, that that would ever happen with either party.

As for disagreeing with John McCain and how our administration would work, what do you expect? A team of mavericks, of course we're not going to agree on 100 percent of everything. As we discuss ANWR there, at least we can agree to disagree on that one. I will keep pushing him on ANWR. I have so appreciated he has never asked me to check my opinions at the door and he wants a deliberative debate and healthy debate so we can make good policy.

What I would do also, if that were to ever happen, though, is to continue the good work he is so committed to of putting government back on the side of the people and get rid of the greed and corruption on Wall Street and in Washington.

I think we need a little bit of reality from Wasilla Main Street there, brought to Washington, D.C.

So that people there can understand how the average working class family is viewing bureaucracy in the federal government and Congress and inaction of Congress.

Just everyday working class Americans saying, you know, government, just get out of my way. If you're going to do any harm and mandate more things on me and take more of my money and income tax and business taxes, you're going to have a choice in just a few weeks here on either supporting a ticket that wants to create jobs and bolster our economy and win the war or you're going to be supporting a ticket that wants to increase taxes, which ultimately kills jobs, and is going to hurt our economy.

Say it ain't so, Joe, there you go again pointing backwards again. You preferenced your whole comment with the Bush administration. Now doggone it, let's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future. You mentioned education and I'm glad you did. I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and god bless her. Her reward is in heaven, right? I say, too, with education, America needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving. Teachers needed to be paid more. I come from a house full of school teachers. My grandma was, my dad who is in the audience today, he's a schoolteacher, had been for many years. My brother, who I think is the best schoolteacher in the year, and here's a shout-out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School, you get extra credit for watching the debate.

Education credit in American has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit lax and we have got to increase the standards. No Child Left Behind was implemented. It's not doing the job though. We need flexibility in No Child Left Behind. We need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching. We need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas, I think, absolute top of the line. My kids as public school participants right now, it's near and dear to my heart. I'm very, very concerned about where we're going with education and we have got to ramp it up and put more attention in that arena.

In my comment there, it was a lame attempt at a joke and yours was a lame attempt at a joke, too, I guess, because nobody got it. Of course we know what a vice president does.

No, no. Of course, we know what a vice president does. And that's not only to preside over the Senate and will take that position very seriously also. I'm thankful the Constitution would allow a bit more authority given to the vice president if that vice president so chose to exert it in working with the Senate and making sure that we are supportive of the president's policies and making sure too that our president understands what our strengths are. John McCain and I have had good conversations about where I would lead with his agenda. That is energy independence in America and reform of government over all, and then working with families of children with special needs. That's near and dear to my heart also. In those arenas, John McCain has already tapped me and said, that's where I want you, I want you to lead. I said, I can't wait to get and there go to work with you.

Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the office of the vice president. And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president's agenda in that position. Yeah, so I do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there, and we'll do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation. And it is my executive experience that is partly to be attributed to my pick as V.P. with McCain, not only as a governor, but earlier on as a mayor, as an oil and gas regulator, as a business owner. It is those years of experience on an executive level that will be put to good use in the White House also.
My experience as an executive will be put to good use as a mayor and business owner and oil and gas regulator and then as governor of a huge state, a huge energy producing state that is accounting for much progress towards getting our nation energy independence and that's extremely important.

But it wasn't just that experience tapped into, it was my connection to the heartland of America. Being a mom, one very concerned about a son in the war, about a special needs child, about kids heading off to college, how are we going to pay those tuition bills? About times and Todd and our marriage in our past where we didn't have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out how are they going to pay out-of-pocket for health care? We've been there also so that connection was important.

But even more important is that world view that I share with John McCain. That world view that says that America is a nation of exceptionalism. And we are to be that shining city on a hill, as President Reagan so beautifully said, that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologetic here. We are not perfect as a nation. But together, we represent a perfect ideal. And that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights. Those things that we stand for that can be put to good use as a force for good in this world.

John McCain and I share that. You combine all that with being a team with the only track record of making a really, a difference in where we've been and reforming, that's a good team, it's a good ticket.

People aren't looking for more of the same. They are looking for change. And John McCain has been the consummate maverick in the Senate over all these years.

He's taken shots left and right from the other party and from within his own party, because he's had to take on his own party when the time was right, when he recognized it was time to put partisanship aside and just do what was right for the American people.

That's what I've done as governor, also, take on my own party, when I had to, and work with both sides of the aisle, in my cabinet, appointing those who would serve regardless of party, Democrats, independents, Republicans, whatever it took to get the job done.

Also, John McCain's maverick position that he's in, that's really prompt up to and indicated by the supporters that he has. Look at Lieberman, and Giuliani, and Romney, and Lingle, and all of us who come from such a diverse background of -- of policy and of partisanship, all coming together at this time, recognizing he is the man that we need to leave -- lead in these next four years, because these are tumultuous times.

We have got to win the wars. We have got to get our economy back on track. We have got to not allow the greed and corruption on Wall Street anymore.

And we have not got to allow the partisanship that has really been entrenched in Washington, D.C., no matter who's been in charge. When the Republicans were in charge, I didn't see a lot of progress there, either. When the Democrats, either, though, this last go- around for the last two years.

Change is coming. And John McCain is the leader of that reform.

There have been times where, as mayor and governor, we have passed budgets that I did not veto and that I think could be considered as something that I quasi-caved in, if you will, but knowing that it was the right thing to do in order to progress the agenda for that year and to work with the legislative body, that body that actually holds the purse strings.

So there were times when I wanted to zero-base budget, and to cut taxes even more, and I didn't have enough support in order to accomplish that.

But on the major principle things, no, there hasn't been something that I've had to compromise on, because we've always seemed to find a way to work together. Up there in Alaska, what we have done is, with bipartisan efforts, is work together and, again, not caring who gets the credit for what, as we accomplish things up there.

And that's been just a part of the operation that I wanted to participate in. And that's what we're going to do in Washington, D.C., also, bring in both sides together. John McCain is known for doing that, also, in order to get the work done for the American people.
You do what I did as governor, and you appoint people regardless of party affiliation, Democrats, independents, Republicans. You -- you walk the walk; you don't just talk the talk.

And even in my own family, it's a very diverse family. And we have folks of all political persuasion in there, also, so I've grown up just knowing that, you know, at the end of the day, as long as we're all working together for the greater good, it's going to be OK.

But the policies and the proposals have got to speak for themselves, also. And, again, voters on November 4th are going to have that choice to either support a ticket that supports policies that create jobs.

You do that by lowering taxes on American workers and on our businesses. And you build up infrastructure, and you rein in government spending, and you make our -- our nation energy independent.

Or you support a ticket that supports policies that will kill jobs by increasing taxes. And that's what the track record shows, is a desire to increase taxes, increase spending, a trillion-dollar spending proposal that's on the table. That's going to hurt our country, and saying no to energy independence. Clear choices on November 4th.

 

Well, again, Gwen, I do want to thank you and the commission. This is such an honor for me.

And I appreciate, too, Sen. Biden, getting to meet you, finally, also, and getting to debate with you. And I would like more opportunity for this.

I like being able to answer these tough questions without the filter, even, of the mainstream media kind of telling viewers what they've just heard. I'd rather be able to just speak to the American people like we just did.

And it's so important that the American people know of the choices that they have on November 4th.

I want to assure you that John McCain and I, we're going to fight for America. We're going to fight for the middle-class, average, everyday American family like mine.

I've been there. I know what the hurts are. I know what the challenges are. And, thank God, I know what the joys are, too, of living in America. We are so blessed. And I've always been proud to be an American. And so has John McCain.

We have to fight for our freedoms, also, economic and our national security freedoms.

It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction. We don't pass it to our children in the bloodstream; we have to fight for it and protect it, and then hand it to them so that they shall do the same, or we're going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling our children and our children's children about a time in America, back in the day, when men and women were free.

We will fight for it, and there is only one man in this race who has really ever fought for you, and that's Sen. John McCain.   We believe that Washington, D.C. needs to take less of our money. It needs more scrutiny, fewer bureaucrats, and it needs a reminder of the principles laid down in the Constitution that our leaders swear to defend. Furthermore, we believe crony capitalism is infecting both sides of the aisle in D.C. We're working really hard to root it out of our party. Senator Warren, what are you doing to root it out of yours? 

  We believe in science and God's magnificent creation overflowing with natural resources. That means we have a responsibility to honor Him by protecting the earth as we develop our resources in an environmentally sound way for mankind's use. 

 We believe the Internet shouldn't be censored by the world's tyrants. That means President Obama should reverse his disastrous decision to hand over control of Internet domain names to the U.N., where it will come under the thumb of authoritarian regimes like Russia and China. 

  We believe in lifting Americans out of poverty and into sustainable jobs. That means government needs to butt out of employer-employee pay issues. And quit over-regulating business and increasing taxes. It drives up operating costs --that's what affects wages. 

  We believe... wait, I thought fast food joints... don't you guys think that they are of the devil or something? Liberals, you want to send those evil employees who would dare work at a fast food joint that you just don't believe in -- thought you wanted to send them to purgatory or something until they all go vegan?! Wages and picket lines, I dunno, they're not often discussed in purgatory, are they?
 We believe in America where minimum-wage jobs are not lifetime gigs. They are stepping stones to a good job with sustainable wages. It teaches work ethic. We believe in helping Americans climb the economic ladder, not get stuck on the first rung. A strong economy with good-paying jobs comes from free enterprise, not from a top-down, bloated, big-government, command-and-control economy. 

  We believe that students learn to not make decisions that result in a lot of debt. And we believe that schools need to be more accountable for the insane increase in tuition... and their insane curriculum--many of 'em. It's no accident, Elizabeth, that the rise in tuition corresponds with the rise in government intervention. More government isn't the answer. 

  We believe a pension is a promise. It must be honored. We do that by using common sense and prioritizing budgets that once and for all will end waste and fraud and the crony capitalism and the stupid political decisions that are bankrupting our nation. We believe that in order to keep faith with future generations and fulfill our current commitments to our seniors, well, we must enact sensible entitlement reform. 
 We believe--I can't believe I have to say this in 2014--we believe in equal pay for equal work. And President Barack Obama should abandon his hypocritical practice of paying women less than men in his campaigns, in his administration, and in the White House. Uhh, the leader of your party, Elizabeth, can set an example for the rest of the country.  

  We believe that all men and women are created equal. They claim that we are not tolerant? Well, we believe that tolerance goes both ways. That means respecting people's right to disagree with you, instead of trying to intimidate or silence us. We believe the answer to free speech that you find offensive is more free speech, not less.  

  We believe that legal immigration helped make this country strong and vibrant. And that means welcoming law-abiding, hard-working immigrants who wish to come here legally and pledge their allegiance to the United States of America. Furthermore, we believe, as none other than Cesar Chavez believed, that illegal immigration hurts the country. It unfairly hurts working-class Americans of all races, all backgrounds who are seeking good-paying jobs, security for their families.  

  We believe women have a right to their bodies, just as babies have a right to their living, breathing bodies nestled in a mother's womb. And anyone who wants contraception, more power to you. Continue to freely buy any kind you want, no one is stopping you. We'll fight for the right of private businesses, including Hobby Lobby, to work with you to figure out health-care coverage themselves in any way the owners of these businesses (that they built themselves) want to, knowing that government intervention just always screws everything up.

 Furthermore, we believe that religious liberty is enshrined in our Constitution, remember?  The government has no right to coerce people to violate their religious beliefs. And if they try to take any of our Constitutional rights away, we will fight for them. 

 We conservatives believe, as Ronald Reagan said, that you can't be for big taxes, big government, big bureaucracy and still be for the little guy,  she concluded.  We stand with the little guy, who is being bullied and beaten down by the progressive left's failed policies--of yours, Elizabeth Warren. 

 We stand for free men and free markets--the twin ideals that made this nation strong, peaceful, and prosperous. We say, God Bless America.
